## 1) Conflicting semantics for “Recommended = N” between §3, §3.1, and RFC 8447

**Concise explanation:**  
§3 defines **N** as “has not been evaluated by the IETF” / “IETF has made no statement” / “no consensus exists,” but in the same paragraph says the IETF might have **consensus** to leave items marked N due to limited applicability. §3.1 (and RFC 8447 §5) define N more broadly: either not through IETF consensus **or** limited applicability/specific use cases. These meanings can’t all be true at once.

**Justification:** ✅ inconsistency 
Experts converge that this is logically contradictory and affects how registries should be interpreted:
- If N means “no evaluation/no statement,” then evaluated-but-limited-use items shouldn’t be N (but §3.1/RFC 8447 allow exactly that).
- If N includes “limited applicability with consensus,” then §3’s “has not been evaluated/no statement” wording is wrong and misleading.

This is a policy/semantics break (not wire-protocol), but it directly governs how designated experts and implementers interpret registry values.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology

**Typical fix direction (expert consensus):**  
Rewrite §3’s N definition to match §3.1 / RFC 8447 §5 (remove “has not been evaluated / no statement” or qualify it as “for general use”).

## 2) Wrong registry name in §5 (Cipher Suites section refers to ExtensionType registry)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 is about the **TLS Cipher Suites** registry (table is cipher suites; mentions DTLS-OK column), but the IANA instruction text at the start of §5 reportedly says to update the **TLS ExtensionType Values** registry—likely a copy/paste error.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (IANA instruction mis-targets registry)  
This would misdirect IANA and readers because it names a different registry than the section content. Multiple experts flagged it as high severity.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (Confidence: High)  
- Terminology (Severity: High)

**Fix direction:**  
Change the §5 instruction to say “TLS Cipher Suites registry” (not “TLS ExtensionType Values”).
