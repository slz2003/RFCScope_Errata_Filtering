ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 12 gives IANA instructions for the “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode” registry: constrain how the “Recommended” column can be set to Y or D, add a reference to this document, retain existing Y/N values, and update the note text for that column.
Overall Bug Likelihood: Low

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timers, or state transitions; this is static registry policy text.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Only IANA actions are specified; no protocol message roles or directions involved.
  - Scope: LOW - Scope (one specific registry and its Recommended column) is clear and local.
  - Causal: LOW - The instructions are straightforward registry-maintenance rules; no non-obvious cause/effect chains.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No numeric ranges or size calculations; just policy text and column values.
  - Deontic: LOW - The normative requirement on how to set Y/D is consistent with the global pattern used elsewhere in the draft and in RFC 8126.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/ASN.1; structure is a simple bullet list of IANA actions.
  - CrossRFC: MEDIUM - The section relies on RFC 8126 terminology and on the existence (and name) of the corresponding IANA registry; potential for registry-name mismatch.
  - Terminology: MEDIUM - The registry name used here may not match the canonical IANA registry name; “Recommended” column semantics otherwise align with Section 3.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behaviors are implied beyond normal “Y/N/D” usage, which is already defined in Section 3.

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CrossRFCReport:
- ExcerptSummary: The draft updates a variety of TLS-related IANA registries, mainly to (a) add or refine the “Recommended” column semantics (Y/N/D) under policies tied to RFC 8126, and (b) add or rename “Comment” columns. Section 12 specifically gives IANA instructions for the TLS PSK key exchange mode registry.
- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: High
- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Misnamed TLS PSK Key Exchange Mode registry
    - Description: The draft refers to a “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry” (no spaces, mixed case, singular “Mode”) in Sections 12 and 14. However, the registry created for TLS 1.3 PSK key exchange modes by RFC 8446/8447 and maintained by IANA is titled “TLS PSK Key Exchange Modes” (with “PSK” all-caps, spaces between words, and plural “Modes”). Using a non-canonical name that looks like an internal identifier rather than the IANA registry title is a cross-document mismatch. A careful reader trying to align this document with the IANA web registry and RFC 8447 could be confused about whether a different registry is meant, particularly since other registry names in the draft match IANA exactly (e.g., “TLS SignatureScheme”, “TLS Supported Groups”). To avoid ambiguity and keep IANA instructions unambiguous, the draft should use the official registry name “TLS PSK Key Exchange Modes” consistently wherever it refers to that registry. I agree with the router’s hypothesis here and refine it to note that both spacing and pluralization are wrong, not just casing.

  - Issue-2:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Wrong registry named in Cipher Suites IANA instructions
    - Description: Section 5 is clearly about the TLS Cipher Suites registry (it discusses cipher suites, EXPORT ciphers, NULL encryption, RC4, DES, etc., and Table 2 lists cipher suite codepoints and names such as TLS_KRB5_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA and TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA). Nonetheless, the IANA instruction immediately after this prose says: “IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows.” That registry is a different IANA registry (for TLS extensions, not cipher suites). If read literally, this would instruct IANA to apply the subsequent Recommended-column policy and “D” markings to the TLS ExtensionType Values registry instead of the TLS Cipher Suites registry. IANA and implementers will almost certainly infer the intended registry from the surrounding context and Table 2, but as written it is a cross-registry mismatch and can mislead careful readers or automated tooling. The instruction should say “TLS Cipher Suites registry” to align with the actual registry being modified.

  - Issue-3:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Inconsistent names for TLS SignatureAlgorithm and HashAlgorithm registries
    - Description: Sections 9 and 10 correctly refer to the “TLS HashAlgorithm registry” and “TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry”, matching the established IANA TLS 1.2 registries. However, Section 14’s list of registries to receive a new “Comment” column instead uses “TLS Signature Algorithm” and “TLS Hash Algorithm” (with a space inserted between “Signature” and “Algorithm” and between “Hash” and “Algorithm”). These strings do not match the canonical IANA registry titles and do not match the earlier usage in this same draft. This creates a cross-document naming inconsistency that can cause momentary confusion about whether a different registry is intended and can complicate IANA’s editorial work and any tooling that tries to match registry names verbatim. The list in Section 14 should be corrected to use “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” and “TLS HashAlgorithm” to align with both IANA and the draft’s own earlier references.

TerminologyAnalysis:
- OverallBugLikelihood: None
- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: None
    - Severity: Low
    - ShortLabel: Name “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode” is consistent with RFC 8447 usage
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 12 of the draft: “IANA is requested to update the TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry as follows: …”
        - Section 14 of the draft lists among registries: “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode”
      - ContextSnippets:
        - RFC 8447 Section 16/Additional Notes: “IANA has added the following notes to the TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry:”
    - Reasoning:
      - The draft under review (rfc8447bis-15) is updating RFC 8447. In RFC 8447, the PSK key exchange mode registry is explicitly called the “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry” in its IANA notes.
      - The draft uses exactly the same registry name string (“TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry” in Section 12 and “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode” in the Section 14 list), so there is *internal* consistency between the bis draft and the base RFC it updates.
      - The router’s hypothesis is that the *canonical* IANA registry name as created by TLS 1.3 might be something like “TLS PSK Key Exchange Modes” (different spacing/casing/pluralization). That could be true, but the provided context does not include RFC 8446’s IANA Considerations or an IANA registry snapshot, so we cannot verify any mismatch against the canonical IANA title.
      - From the standpoint of this excerpt plus RFC 8447, implementers and IANA can unambiguously identify which registry is meant: the same TLS PSK key exchange modes registry that RFC 8447 already calls “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode”. There is no conflicting alternative name *within* the provided documents that would point to a different registry, nor are there two different names used for this registry in the bis draft itself.
      - Therefore, while a global cleanup (aligning the name with whatever RFC 8446 and IANA use) might be editorially desirable, there is no demonstrable terminology *bug* here based on the available material, and no erratum is clearly justified on that ground alone.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - None.

- Notes:
  - UsedRouterIssues: Considered the router’s candidate about a possible mismatch with the canonical IANA registry name; rejected it as a confirmed bug because RFC 8447 already uses “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode” and the bis draft is consistent with that usage.
  - NewIssuesFromExpert: false
  - Limitations:
    - The provided files do not include RFC 8446’s IANA Considerations text nor an authoritative IANA registry view, so it is not possible to conclusively check whether “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode” differs from the actual IANA display name (e.g., “TLS PSK Key Exchange Modes”). Any such discrepancy, if it exists, cannot be confirmed from the given context and therefore is not treated as a proven terminology bug here.
