## Issue 1 — “Subject name matches” looks unconditional in the overview

**Errata title:** Section 2 step 5 may overstate that the subject name must match (vs policy-based equivalence later)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 2 step 5 says “The subject name matches the one from step 3.” Later normative sections (e.g., Section 3 / Section 6) allow subject/SAN differences if certificate policy defines how to determine equivalence; otherwise the CA must reject. The overview sentence can be read as prescriptive even though it’s intended as the “common case” narrative.

**Justification:**   
- The **Deontic expert** finds **no normative conflict** because Section 2 is an Overview and does **not** use BCP 14 all-caps keywords for that sentence, while Sections 3–6 contain the actual MUST/SHOULD requirements (including the conditional acceptance when policy defines equivalence).  
- The **Scope expert** still flags possible reader confusion (“looks unconditional”), but that’s more “could be clarified” than “spec is underspecified/broken.”

**Optional clarifying edit (if you want a clean-up):**  
Change step 5 to something like:  
> “Typically, the subject name matches the one from step 3; if not, see Sections 3 and 6 for the policy-based equivalence rules.”
