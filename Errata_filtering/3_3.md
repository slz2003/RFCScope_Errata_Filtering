# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §5 (TLS Cipher Suites Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 5 (TLS Cipher Suites registry updates)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Wrong IANA registry named in Section 5 (ExtensionType vs Cipher Suites)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 is titled **“TLS Cipher Suites Registry”**, discusses cipher-suite categories, references the **DTLS-OK** column, and presents a table of cipher suite code points. However, the operative IANA instruction says:

> “IANA is requested to update the **TLS ExtensionType Values registry** as follows:”

This names the *wrong registry*.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (normative IANA instruction error)  
All experts agree this is a copy-and-paste error with real consequences:
- The TLS ExtensionType Values registry does **not** contain cipher suites or a DTLS-OK column.
- If followed literally, the instruction is unexecutable and misdirects IANA.
- Section 4 already correctly updates the ExtensionType registry; Section 5 must target the Cipher Suites registry.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology  

**Fix direction:**  
Replace the registry name in Section 5 with:
> **“TLS Cipher Suites registry”**

## 2) Ambiguous scope: “discouraged categories” vs. the specific suites marked “D”

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 opens with:
> “Several categories of ciphersuites are discouraged for general use and are marked as ‘D’.”

It then lists *categories* (NULL encryption, EXPORT, anon, RC4, DES, IDEA, MD5, SHA-1).  
But the IANA instruction immediately says:
> “Entries keep their existing ‘Y’ and ‘N’ entries except for the entries in the following table,”

and Table 2 marks **only a limited subset** of cipher suites as **D**.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Real ambiguity (scope + underspecification)  
Experts disagree on severity, but converge that the text is misleading:
- The prose suggests **entire categories** are marked D.
- The registry changes apply **only to listed entries**.
- Many well-known suites in those categories (e.g., classic TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_* or RC4 suites) remain **N** after applying this document.
- It is unclear whether the category discussion is:
  - merely *background justification* for the listed entries, or
  - a *normative rule* implying that all such suites should be D now or in the future.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  

**Fix direction:**  
Clarify intent explicitly, e.g.:
- “The following categories motivate the D markings below; **only the cipher suites listed in Table 2 are marked D by this document**,”  
or
- expand the table/instructions to cover all suites in those categories.

## 3) Missing per-entry rationale for D-marking TLS_SHA256_SHA256 and TLS_SHA384_SHA384

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 requires that when an entry is marked **D**, the **References or Comments column MUST explain why**.  
In Table 2, the suites:
- `TLS_SHA256_SHA256` (0xC0,B4)  
- `TLS_SHA384_SHA384` (0xC0,B5)  

are marked **D**, but Section 5 provides **no explanation** for discouraging them, and they do not fall under the listed weak-algorithm categories.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Real underspecification (violates the draft’s own MUST)  
Experts note:
- For other D-marked suites, rationale can be inferred from cited RFCs (7465 for RC4, 5469 for DES/IDEA, etc.).
- For these two suites, the only added reference is **this document**, which does **not** explain the reason.
- As a result, IANA cannot satisfy the Section 3 MUST (“sufficient information to determine why the marking has been applied”).

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  

**Fix direction:**  
Add an explicit rationale (in text and/or instruct IANA to add a Comment), e.g.:
- why these suites are obsolete, unused, experimental, or problematic,
- and/or add a concrete external reference that explains the discouragement.

## 4) Overbroad claim about MD5 and SHA-1 being “deprecated in RFC 9155”

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 says:
> “Nor is MD5 or SHA-1 and these are deprecated in [RFC9155].”

But RFC 9155 **only deprecates MD5 and SHA-1 for digital signatures**, and explicitly **does not** deprecate SHA-1 with HMAC for record protection.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Cross-RFC inconsistency / misleading wording  
Experts warn this wording:
- overstates the scope of RFC 9155,
- can mislead readers into thinking *all* uses of MD5/SHA-1 in TLS cipher suites are deprecated by that RFC,
- which is not what RFC 9155 says.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC  
- Deontic  

**Fix direction:**  
Qualify the statement to match RFC 9155’s scope (signatures only), or cite additional references if broader discouragement is intended.

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues for §5 (deduplicated):**
1. **Wrong registry named** in IANA instruction (ExtensionType vs Cipher Suites) — *clear erratum*.
2. **Category prose vs table mismatch** for what is actually marked D — *scope ambiguity*.
3. **No rationale for D-marking TLS_SHA256_SHA256 / TLS_SHA384_SHA384** — *violates Section 3 MUST*.
4. **Overbroad citation of RFC 9155** for MD5/SHA-1 — *cross-RFC inconsistency*.

These are **registry-policy and documentation correctness bugs**, not wire-protocol issues, but several are strong candidates for errata or pre-publication fixes.
