# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §9 (TLS HashAlgorithm Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 9 (TLS HashAlgorithm registry updates)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) “D” markings (especially `sha224`) lack the required per-entry explanatory References/Comments

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 requires that when an entry is marked **D**, the entry’s **Reference or Comment** must contain enough information to determine *why* it is discouraged. Section 9 marks `md5`, `sha1`, and `sha224` as **D**, but provides no clear per-entry rationale—especially for `sha224`.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency / underspecification (violates the document’s own MUST)  
Experts argue:
- Other parts of the draft attach explicit per-entry rationale (URLs/refs) for D-marked items (e.g., truncated_hmac, discouraged curves).
- Section 9’s instructions are generic (“add a reference to this document under the reference heading” + add the generic Recommended note), which may not satisfy the per-entry MUST.
- For `md5`/`sha1`, rationale can plausibly be inferred via existing or expected references (e.g., RFC 9155 scope), but for `sha224` there is no cited deprecation/weakness rationale in this document, so the “why” is missing.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Deontic (highlights sha224 specifically)  
- CrossRFC (emphasizes missing rationale, especially sha224)  
- Boundary (frames it as a D-marking compliance issue; especially sha224)

**Fix direction:**  
Add explicit rationale and/or per-entry references/comments for each D-marked hash, especially `sha224` (or reconsider whether `sha224` should be D at all).

## 2) `none` (value 0) marked Recommended = Y (experts mixed; mostly a clarity/design concern)

**Concise explanation:**  
Table 4 sets `0 | none | Y`. Some experts argue “none” is a sentinel/non-cryptographic hash value with very limited meaning, so marking it **Y** without applicability constraints is misleading and inconsistent with the spirit of Y (“fit for purpose”).

**Justification:** ⚠️ Mixed assessment  
- **Scope** and **CrossRFC** argue this is problematic: it can be misread as “recommended hash choice” and is inconsistent with broader discouragement of anonymous/no-auth configurations (and with `anonymous` not being recommended elsewhere).
- **Causal**, **Deontic**, and **Boundary** do **not** treat it as a strict normative bug: the draft is registry metadata, not protocol behavior; “Y” is defined as “fit for the purpose for which it was defined,” and the constrained semantics of `none` are governed by base TLS specs.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope (flags as both inconsistency + underspecification)  
- CrossRFC (cross-registry/cross-RFC tension; medium confidence)  
- Causal (says not a causal/protocol bug)  
- Deontic (explicitly labels it “None” as a deontic bug)  
- Boundary (explicitly labels it “None” as a boundary bug)

**Fix direction (optional clarity):**  
If the WG wants to avoid confusion, change `none` to **N** (or add a Comment clarifying it is a sentinel/limited-use value and must only be used as specified in TLS base specs).

---

## 3) Registry-name mismatch elsewhere: “TLS Hash Algorithm” vs “TLS HashAlgorithm” (cross-reference consistency)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 9 uses “TLS HashAlgorithm” consistently, but Section 14 elsewhere lists “TLS Hash Algorithm” (spaced), creating inconsistent registry naming across the document.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Minor but real inconsistency  
This can confuse exact IANA registry references, though humans can infer intent.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (high confidence)  
- Terminology (also flags the same naming drift)

**Fix direction:**  
Normalize to the canonical registry name everywhere (likely the no-space form used in Section 9).

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues for §9 (deduplicated):**
1. **D-marked hashes lack required “why” documentation**, especially `sha224` (strong errata candidate).
2. **`none` marked Y** is potentially misleading; experts disagree whether it’s a bug vs a design/clarity choice.
3. **Registry-name spelling drift** (“HashAlgorithm” vs “Hash Algorithm”) elsewhere in the draft (editorial consistency).
