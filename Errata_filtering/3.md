## 1) IANA table column mismatch: uses “Format” (or “Format Reference”) instead of the registry’s “Reference” field

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 9460 defines the SvcParamKeys registry fields as **Number, Name, Meaning, Reference, Change Controller**. The draft’s Section 9 modification table for `ech` uses a column labeled **“Format”** (or a two-line header that reads like “Format / Reference”), and places “(This document)” in that column. This does not match the registry schema.

**Justification:** ✅ inconsistenc, editorial but worth fixing  
Experts agree this is formally inconsistent with RFC 9460’s mandated registry fields and table headings. Even if IANA can infer the intended meaning (“(This document)” is clearly a *reference*), the mislabeling can confuse readers and any tooling that expects the canonical “Reference” field.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural (High likelihood; provides patch suggestion)  
- CrossRFC (High confidence)  
- Terminology (Low severity but confirms inconsistency)

**Suggested fix (from experts):**  
- Replace the column header **“Format”** with **“Reference”** and format the cell as the normal reference (“RFC XXXX” / “(This document)” per RFC-Editor style).
