# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — Section 9 (IANA Considerations)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 9 (IANA registry update for SvcParamKey 5 “ech”)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) IANA table column mismatch: uses “Format” (or “Format Reference”) instead of the registry’s “Reference” field

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 9460 defines the SvcParamKeys registry fields as **Number, Name, Meaning, Reference, Change Controller**. The draft’s Section 9 modification table for `ech` uses a column labeled **“Format”** (or a two-line header that reads like “Format / Reference”), and places “(This document)” in that column. This does not match the registry schema.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (structural + cross-RFC), likely editorial but worth fixing  
Experts agree this is formally inconsistent with RFC 9460’s mandated registry fields and table headings. Even if IANA can infer the intended meaning (“(This document)” is clearly a *reference*), the mislabeling can confuse readers and any tooling that expects the canonical “Reference” field.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural (High likelihood; provides patch suggestion)  
- CrossRFC (High confidence)  
- Terminology (Low severity but confirms inconsistency)

**Suggested fix (from experts):**  
- Replace the column header **“Format”** with **“Reference”** and format the cell as the normal reference (“RFC XXXX” / “(This document)” per RFC-Editor style).

## 2) Registry name wording mismatch: “DNS SVCB Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)” vs RFC 9460’s registry title

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 9460 names the subregistry **“Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)”** on the **“DNS Service Bindings (SVCB)”** IANA page. The draft instead refers to **“DNS SVCB Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)”**, inserting extra words not in the defined registry name.

**Justification:** ✅ Minor inconsistency / terminology error (low risk but should be corrected)  
Experts agree this is not likely to cause operational issues (humans/IANA can infer the target registry), but it is technically inaccurate relative to RFC 9460 and could create minor confusion.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (Confidence: Medium)  
- Terminology (Low severity)

**Suggested fix (from experts):**  
- Change wording to: **“In the ‘Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)’ registry on the ‘DNS Service Bindings (SVCB)’ page…”**

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues (deduplicated):**
1. **Structural field mismatch** in the IANA update table: “Format” should be “Reference”.
2. **Registry name mis-stated**: should match RFC 9460’s “Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)”.

These are primarily **editorial/structural conformance** issues, but they are clean errata candidates because they directly affect IANA instruction clarity.
