## 1) Link certificates are OPTIONAL, but Case 2/3 verification procedures assume they exist (newWithOld / oldWithNew)

**Concise explanation:**  
`newWithOld` and `oldWithNew` are OPTIONAL in `RootCaKeyUpdateContent` and CA-operator steps. But §4.4.2 Case 2 and Case 3 start by instructing the verifier to fetch these link certificates, without clearly defining behavior when they are legitimately omitted.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Mixed expert assessment  
- **Temporal**, **Scope**, **Deontic**, **Structural**: treat as a real inconsistency/underspecification (allowed omission but only success-path described).
- **Causal**: treats it as “mild underspecification” (needs a note/conditionality).
- **Boundary**: does *not* consider it a bug (omission just means validation fails under normal X.509 path-building; it’s an operator choice).

**Net:** There is at least a strong **clarity gap**: the spec should state explicitly that Case 2/3 procedures apply only when the corresponding link certs are present, and point to alternative trust-anchor distribution mechanisms otherwise.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Temporal, Scope, Deontic, Structural, Causal  
(Boundary disagrees it’s a “bug” but acknowledges the limitation.)

**Fix direction:**  
Add explicit conditional text (“if the link cert is available… else rely on OOBCert/other mechanisms or fail”) and/or normatively constrain when link certs may be omitted.

## 2) LDAP/X.500 attribute name mismatch: `caCertificate` vs standard `cACertificate`

**Concise explanation:**  
§4.4 first references the standard LDAP attribute `cACertificate`, but later Case 2/3 steps tell implementers to look up certs in `caCertificate`, which is inconsistent with RFC 5280 / RFC 4523 naming.

**Justification:** inconsistency (naming/interop documentation)  
Even if many LDAP stacks treat attribute names case-insensitively, the RFC should use the canonical schema name consistently to avoid confusion.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology

**Fix direction:**  
Replace `caCertificate` with `cACertificate` in the affected procedural steps.
