## 1) Ambiguous / non-standard composite registration policy for changing “Recommended” = Y/D

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 6 repeats the global policy sentence (from §3):

> “Setting a value to ‘Y’ or ‘D’ or transitioning the value from ‘Y’ or ‘D’ in the ‘Recommended’ column requires **IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval** [RFC8126].”

This is not a standard RFC 8126 policy name and is grammatically ambiguous.

**Justification:** underspecification (BCP 26 policy ambiguity)  
Experts agree:
- RFC 8126 defines **Standards Action**, **Expert Review**, and **IESG Approval** as separate well-known policies.
- RFC 8126 warns against hybrid phrases (“…only causes confusion”) and requires clear guidance when combining policies.
- The phrase can be read multiple ways (Standards Action + Expert Review vs alternative paths vs IESG-only backstop), so IANA/designated experts cannot apply it mechanically.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Rewrite using canonical RFC 8126 terms with an explicit combination rule (e.g., “either Standards Action or IESG Approval; designated expert review required in all cases”).

## 3) Comment-column inconsistency: §6 uses a “Comment” column link but §14’s “add Comment column” list omits Supported Groups

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 6 instructs IANA to “add the following link to the **Comment** column” for each discouraged group. But:
- RFC 8447’s description of the TLS Supported Groups registry added a “Recommended” column and registry notes/warnings, **not** a per-entry Comment/Notes column.
- Later, Section 14 of the same draft claims its list covers “all registries that do not already have a Comment/Notes column,” yet **TLS Supported Groups is not listed**.

**Justification:** underspecification 
Experts argue this leaves IANA without a clear instruction path:
- Either Supported Groups already has a Comment column (contrary to RFC 8447’s description), or
- it doesn’t, in which case §6 needs to instruct IANA to create it (or §14 must include it).

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (Confidence: Medium–High)

**Fix direction:**  
Either:
- add TLS Supported Groups to §14’s “add Comment column” list, **or**
- explicitly instruct in §6 that IANA must add a Comment/Notes column to the TLS Supported Groups registry before adding per-entry links.
