# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §7 (TLS Exporter Labels Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 7 (TLS Exporter Labels registry policy/notes update)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Conflicting guidance on whether a public specification is required for TLS Exporter Labels (Expert Review vs “ensure spec is publicly available”)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 7 changes the TLS Exporter Labels registry from **Specification Required** to **Expert Review** and says:
> “Even though this registry does not require a specification, the designated expert … will strongly encourage registrants to provide a link…”

But the document’s generic designated-expert guidance (in its Section 17 / carried-over text) says, without scoping:
> “Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available…”

If read globally, that re-imposes a de facto “spec required” rule, contradicting Section 7’s explicit policy relaxation.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency / scope confusion  
Experts argue this creates two incompatible interpretations of what designated experts must do for this registry:
- **Strict reading:** DE must require a public spec (because they must “ensure” it exists) → effectively still Specification Required.
- **Section 7 reading:** no spec is required; it is only encouraged → pure Expert Review.

This affects registrants and DEs in practice: approvals may differ depending on which text is treated as authoritative.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  

**Fix direction:**  
Scope the “ensure the specification is publicly available” statement to **Specification Required** registries only, or explicitly exempt TLS Exporter Labels (and any other Expert-Review-only registries).

## 2) Stale / mis-scoped reference: Section 7 points to RFC 8447 §17 for “role of the designated expert”

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 7 includes:
> “Note: The role of the designated expert is described in [RFC8447], Section 17.”

But this document is a **bis** updating RFC 8447 and also contains its own designated-expert guidance. Pointing to the older RFC can be confusing/brittle, especially since Section 7 is changing the exporter-labels policy from Specification Required to Expert Review.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Likely inconsistency / clarity issue (experts disagree on severity)  
- **Scope** treats this as an inconsistency: the registry should point to the *updated* expert-role guidance in this document, not the one it updates.
- **Deontic** bundles this into the larger “spec required vs not required” confusion: referencing the old text may reintroduce assumptions tied to Specification Required.

However, in the provided expert set, **CrossRFC** says this is not clearly incorrect, and **Terminology** explicitly labels it **not a real issue** (arguing Section 15 is for Specification Required registries and the RFC 8447 reference can remain descriptive).

**Net:** This is best categorized as a **clarity / future-proofing** issue rather than a hard contradiction—unless RFC 8447 §17 truly conflicts with the new Expert Review intent.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope (flags it)  
- Deontic (as part of overall inconsistency)  
*(CrossRFC and Terminology do not treat it as a bug in the provided analyses.)*

**Fix direction (low-cost):**  
Change the note to reference this document’s own designated-expert guidance (or explicitly state which parts of RFC 8447 remain applicable).

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues for §7 (deduplicated):**
1. **Spec-required confusion:** Section 7 says no spec required (Expert Review), but generic DE guidance says DE “ensures” a public spec exists → inconsistent scoping.
2. **Potentially stale reference** to RFC 8447 §17 for DE role (experts mixed; likely a clarity/future-proofing fix).
