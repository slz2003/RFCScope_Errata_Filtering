## 1) Misstated cross-RFC claim: RFC 9809 says RFC 9336 §4 defines a procedure for EKU *combinations*, but RFC 9336 says combinations are out of scope

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 9809 §6 states that:
> “The procedure for allowing or disallowing **combinations** of KeyPurposeIds … is defined in Section 4 of [RFC9336].”

But RFC 9336 §4 explicitly says its procedure is intended for permitting/prohibiting **a single KeyPurposeId** (or complete absence of EKU) and that handling **combinations** is *outside its scope* (only discussed at a high level elsewhere).

**Justification:** inconsistency (cross-RFC scope mismatch)  
All experts agree the reference overclaims what RFC 9336 §4 actually specifies:
- Implementers looking for a defined, normative combination algorithm in RFC 9336 will not find one.
- They must invent combination logic even though RFC 9809 implies it is already standardized there.
- This can cause divergent behavior and confusion about how to enforce combination-based EKU restrictions intended to mitigate cross-protocol attacks.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Rephrase RFC 9809 §6 to accurately scope RFC 9336’s contribution, e.g.:
- RFC 9336 §4 defines an Excluded/Permitted processing model for individual KeyPurposeIds; relying parties and application profiles may adapt/extend that model to combinations, but the combination logic itself is policy-/profile-specific.
