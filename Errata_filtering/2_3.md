## 1) Inconsistent naming of the SSLKEYLOGFILE labels registry

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 4.2 uses **two different names** for the same new registry:
- Creation instruction: `"TLS SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels"`
- Later policy text and section title: `"SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels"`

RFC 8126 requires documents to use the **exact registry name consistently**.

**Justification:**  Real inconsistency 
While IANA can likely infer the intent, inconsistent registry naming:
- Creates ambiguity about the canonical registry name.
- Can mislead future specifications that need to cite the registry precisely.
- Violates RFC 8126 guidance on clear, exact registry identification.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC

**Suggested fix:**  
Choose **one canonical registry name** and use it everywhere. For example:
- If the intended name is **“TLS SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels”**, then:
  - Update the section title, policy text, and all references to match.
- Alternatively, if **“SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels”** is preferred, change the quoted creation name accordingly.
