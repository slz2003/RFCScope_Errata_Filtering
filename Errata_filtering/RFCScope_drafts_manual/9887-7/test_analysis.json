    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No sequencing, timers, or ordering behavior is specified here; it just declares a registry entry."

      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No sender/receiver roles or directional behaviors are involved in the IANA registration text."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The scope (TCP only, specific service name, specific port) is clear and consistent with the rest of the document."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Declaring a service name and port does not create algorithmic or behavioral cause–effect chains that could break interoperability."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The only number is the port value 300, consistently used elsewhere (Sections 3.1 and 5.2) and properly tied to TCP; no ranges or size calculations are involved."

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "There are no new RFC 2119 requirements here; just a description of an IANA action and a pointer to justification in Section 5.3."

      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The IANA template fields (Service Name, Port Number, Transport Protocol, Description, Assignee, Contact, Reference) match standard registry structure; no ABNF/YANG/ASN.1 appears."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The only cross-reference is to the IANA “Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry” and an internal reference to Section 5.3; nothing appears inconsistent with RFC 8907 or RFC 5425."

      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Names (“tacacss”, TCP, TLS, TACACS+) are used consistently with earlier sections; the slightly odd phrase “new well-known system” appears to be a minor wording quirk, not a semantic inconsistency."

Any apparent oddity such as the phrase “new well-known system” is purely editorial and does not affect protocol behavior, interoperability, or the correctness of the IANA registry entry. No errata-worthy technical or normative issue is evident."
