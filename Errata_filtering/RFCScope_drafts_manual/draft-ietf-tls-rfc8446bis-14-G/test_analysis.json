      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The changelog mentions changes over draft versions, but no protocol event ordering or state sequencing is specified here."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "It only narrates what was changed; no sender/receiver behavior is normatively defined."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Mentions of “clarify X” or “upgrade requirement to MUST” are descriptive of edits already present elsewhere; no new scope rules are introduced here."

      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "It does not prescribe behavior; it only documents that other sections were modified."

      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No numeric limits or sizes are defined here beyond referencing that key usage limits text was ported; the actual limits live in Sections 4.6.3 and 5.5, which are already internally consistent."

      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "It reports that some requirements were upgraded (e.g., SHOULD→MUST) but the operative requirements are in the main body; no conflicting MUST/SHOULD appears in G itself."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "This is prose meta-information, not ABNF/YANG/structures; nothing to cross-check structurally."

      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "It notes that references to RFC 9147, RFC 8773, RFC 9525 were added and extension tables updated, but those details are specified—and appear consistent—in the corresponding sections."

      "Terminology": {

      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No edge-case behavior is defined; it merely states that clarifications (e.g., ignoring NST when no resumption) were added to normative sections."

No internal contradictions or mismatches between what G claims and what the body of the draft specifies are apparent, so there is nothing here that would translate into a protocol or interoperability bug."
