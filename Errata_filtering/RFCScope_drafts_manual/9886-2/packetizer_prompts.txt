You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 2 of RFC 9886 sets up terminology: it provides the BCP 14 normative-keyword boilerplate and lists which existing DRIP terms from earlier RFCs (9153, 9434, 9374) are reused in this document.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Purely definitional; no sequencing, timers, or state transitions.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No sender/receiver or role behaviors are specified here, only term imports.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope is simply “terms used in this document”; there is no subtle per-context rule here beyond stating that the list is a subset.
  - Causal: LOW - No algorithms or cause–effect instructions; nothing executable depends directly on this text.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No ranges, sizes, or numeric limits are defined in this section.
  - Deontic: LOW - The BCP 14 boilerplate exactly matches RFC 8174’s recommended text; no conflicting requirement levels are introduced here.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/CDDL or similar formalism in this section; just prose and references.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 2119, RFC 8174, RFC 9153, RFC 9434, and RFC 9374 appear correct and are used in the standard way for terminology import.
  - Terminology: LOW - Section 2.2 explicitly says it lists only subsets of reused terms, grouped by source RFC; there is no claim of completeness, and the imported terms and sources match the cited RFC sections.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge cases or boundary conditions are involved in these definitions.

Candidate Issues: 1

  Issue 1:
    Type: None
    Label: No substantive inconsistencies or underspecification in Section 2 terminology handling
    Relevant Dimensions: 
    Sketch: Section 2 correctly installs the BCP 14 boilerplate and clearly states that it reuses a subset of te...
