Only very limited operational information can\n   be sent via Broadcast RID, but extended information is sometimes\n   needed.  The most essential element of information from RID is the\n   UAS ID, the unique key for lookup of extended information in relevant\n   registries (see Figure 1, which is the same as Figure 4 of\n   [RFC9434]).\n\n  ***************                                        ***************\n  *    UAS1     *                                        *     UAS2    *\n  *             *                                        *             *\n  * +--------+  *                 DAA/V2V                *  +--------+ *\n  * |   UA   o--*----------------------------------------*--o   UA   | *\n  * +--o--o--+  *                                        *  +--o--o--+ *\n  *    |  |     *   +------+      Lookups     +------+   *     |  |    *\n  *    |  |     *   | GPOD o------.    .------o PSOD |   *     |  |    *\n  *    |  |     *   +------+      |    |      +------+   *     |  |    *\n  *    |  |     *                 |    |                 *     |  |    *\n  * C2 |  |     *     V2I      ************     V2I      *     |  | C2 *\n  *    |  '-----*--------------*          *--------------*-----'  |    *\n  *    |        *              *          *              *        |    *\n  *    |        o====Net-RID===*          *====Net-RID===o        |    *\n  * +--o--+     *              * Internet *              *     +--o--+ *\n  * | GCS o-----*--------------*          *--------------*-----o GCS | *\n  * +-----+     * Registration *          * Registration *     +-----+ *\n  *             * (and UTM)    *          * (and UTM)    *             *\n  ***************              ************              ***************\n                                 |  |  |\n                  +----------+   |  |  |   +----------+\n                  | Public   o---'  |  '---o Private  |\n                  | Registry |      |      | Registry |\n                  +----------+      |      +----------+\n                                 +--o--+\n                                 | DNS |\n                                 +-----+\n\n  DAA:  Detect And Avoid\n  GPOD: General Public Observer Device\n  PSOD: Public Safety Observer Device\n  V2I:  Vehicle-to-Infrastructure\n  V2V:  Vehicle-to-Vehicle\n\n      Figure 1: Global UAS RID Usage Scenario (Figure 4 of RFC 9434)\n\n   When a DRIP Entity Tag (DET) [RFC9374] is used as the UAS ID in RID,\n   extended information can be retrieved from a DRIP Identity Management\n   Entity (DIME), which manages registration of and associated lookups\n   from DETs.  In this document it is assumed the DIME is a function of\n   UAS Service Suppliers (USS) (Appendix A.2 of [RFC9434]), but a DIME\n   can be independent or handled by another entity as well.\n\n1.1. General Concept\n\n   DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) embed a hierarchy scheme that is mapped onto\n   the Domain Name System (DNS) [STD13].  DIMEs enforce registration and\n   information access of data associated with a DET while also providing\n   the trust inherited from being a member of the hierarchy.  Other\n   identifiers and their methods are out of scope for this document.\n\n   Authoritative name servers of the DNS provide the public information\n   such as the cryptographic keys, endorsements and certificates of\n   DETs, and pointers to private information resources.  Cryptographic\n   (public) keys are used to authenticate anything signed by a DET, such\n   as in the Authentication Messages defined in [RFC9575] for Broadcast\n   RID.  Endorsements and certificates are used to endorse the claim of\n   being part of the hierarchy.\n\n   This document does not specify AAA mechanisms used by Private\n   Information Registries to store and protect Personally Identifiable\n   Information (PII).\n\n\n1.2. Scope\n\n   The scope of this document is the DNS registration of DETs with the\n   DNS delegation of the reverse domain of the IPv6 prefix (2001:30::/28\n   for DETs) and RRsets used to handle DETs.\n\n\n2. Terminology\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1. Required Terminology\n\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n\n\n2.2. Additional Definitions\n\n   This document makes use of the terms and abbreviations from previous\n   DRIP documents.  Below are subsets, grouped by original document, of\n   terms used this document.  Please see those documents for additional\n   context, definitions, and any further referenced material.\n\n   From Section 2.2 of [RFC9153], this document uses: AAA, CAA, GCS,\n   ICAO, PII, Observer, Operator, UA, UAS, USS, and UTM.\n\n   From Section 2 of [RFC9434], this document uses: Certificate, DIME,\n   and Endorsement.\n\n   From Section 2 of [RFC9374], this document uses: HDA, HID, and RAA.\n\n\n3. DET Hierarchy in DNS\n\n   [RFC9374] defines the Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHIT) and\n   further specifies an instance of them used for UAS RID called DET.\n   The DET is a 128-bit value that is an IPv6 address intended primarily\n   as an identifier rather than locator.  The format is shown in\n   Figure 2 and further information is in [RFC9374].\n\n    +-------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+\n    | IPv6 Prefix | Hierarchy ID | HHIT Suite ID | ORCHID Hash |\n    | (28 bits)   | (28 bits)    | (8 bits)      | (64 bits)   |\n    +-------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+\n                 /                \\\n                /                  \\\n               /                    \\-----------------------------\\\n              /                                                    \\\n             /                                                      \\\n            +--------------------------------+-----------------------+\n            | Registered Assigning Authority | HHIT Domain Authority |\n            | (14 bits)                      | (14 bits)             |\n            +--------------------------------+-----------------------+\n\n                    Figure 2: DRIP Entity Tag Breakdown\n\n   [RFC9374] assigns the IPv6 prefix 2001:30::/28 for DETs.  Its\n   corresponding domain name for reverse lookups is\n   3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.. The IAB has administrative control of this\n   domain name.\n\n   Due to the nature of the hierarchy split and its relationship to\n   nibble reversing of the IPv6 address (Section 2.5 of RFC 3596   [STD88]), the upper level of the hierarchy (i.e., Registered\n   Assigning Authority (RAA)) \"borrows\" the upper two bits of their\n   respective HHIT Domain Authority (HDA) space for DNS delegation.  As\n   such, the IPv6 prefix of RAAs is 2001:3x:xxx0::/44 and HDAs is\n   2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56 with respective nibble reverse domains of\n   x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. and\n   y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa..\n\n   This document preallocates a subset of RAAs based on the ISO 3166-1\n   Numeric Nation Code [ISO3166-1].  This is to support the initial use\n   case of DETs in UAS RID on an international level.  See Section 6.2.1   for the RAA allocations.\n\n   The HDA values of 0, 4096, 8192, and 12288 are reserved for\n   operational use of an RAA (a by-product of the above mentioned\n   borrowing of bits), in particular to specify when to register with\n   the apex and endorse delegations of HDAs in their namespace.\n\n   The administration, management, and policy for the operation of a\n   DIME at any level in the hierarchy (Apex, RAA or HDA) is out of scope\n   for this document.  For RAAs or DETs allocated on a per-country\n   basis, these considerations should be determined by the appropriate\n   national authorities, presumably the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\n\n3.1. Use of Existing DNS Models\n\n   DRIP relies on the DNS and as such roughly follows the registrant-\n   registrar-registry model.  In the UAS ecosystem, the registrant would\n   be the end user who owns/controls the Unmanned Aircraft.  They are\n   ultimately responsible for the DET and any other information that\n   gets published in the DNS.  Registrants use agents known as\n   registrars to manage their interactions with the registry.\n   Registrars typically provide optional additional services such as DNS\n   hosting.\n\n   The registry maintains a database of the registered domain names and\n   their related metadata such as the contact details for domain name\n   holder and the relevant registrar.  The registry provides DNS service\n   for the zone apex, which contains delegation information for domain\n   names.  Registries generally provide services such as the\n   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [STD95] or equivalent to\n   publish metadata about the registered domain names and their\n   registrants and registrars.\n\n   Registrants have contracts with registrars who in turn have contracts\n   with registries.  Payments follow this model too: the registrant buys\n   services from a registrar who pays for services provided by the\n   registry.\n\n   By definition, there can only be one registry for a domain name.  A\n   registry can have an arbitrary number of registrars who compete with\n   each other on price, service, and customer support.\n\n3.1.1.

It could add costs and complexity to develop policies\n   and contracts as outlined above.  On the other hand, registries and\n   registrars offer customer service and support and can provide the\n   supporting infrastructure for reliable DNS and RDAP service.\n\n   Another approach could be to handle DRIP registrations in a\n   comparable way to how IP address space gets provisioned.  Here,\n   blocks of addresses get delegated to a \"trusted\" third party,\n   typically an ISP, who then issues IP addresses to its customers.  For\n   DRIP, blocks of IP addresses could be delegated from the\n   3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. domain (reverse domain of prefix allocated by\n   [RFC9374]) to an entity chosen by the appropriate Civil Aviation\n   Authority (CAA).  This third party would be responsible for the\n   corresponding DNS and RDAP infrastructure for these IP address\n   blocks.  They would also provision the HHIT records [RFC9374] for\n   these IP addresses.  In principle, a manufacturer or vendor of UAS\n   devices could provide that role.  This is shown as an example in\n   Figure 3.\n\n   Dynamic DRIP registration is another possible solution, for example\n   when the operator of a UAS device registers its corresponding HHIT\n   record and other resources before a flight and deletes them\n   afterwards.  This may be feasible in controlled environments with\n   well-behaved actors.  However, this approach may not scale since each\n   device is likely to need credentials for updating the IT\n   infrastructure that provisions the DNS.\n\n   Registration policies (pricing, renewals, registrar, and registrant\n   agreements, etc.) will need to be developed.  These considerations\n   should be determined by the CAA, perhaps in consultation with local\n   stakeholders to assess the cost-benefits of these approaches (and\n   others).  All of these are out of scope for this document.  The\n   specifics for the UAS RID use case are detailed in the rest of\n   document.\n\n\n\n4. Public Information Registry\n\n   Per [RFC9434], all information classified as public is stored in the\n   DNS, specifically authoritative name servers, to satisfy REG-1 from\n   [RFC9153].\n\n   Authoritative name servers use domain names as identifiers and data\n   is stored in Resource Records (RRs) with associated RRTypes.  This\n   document defines two new RRTypes, one for HHIT metadata (HHIT,Section 5.1) and another for UAS Broadcast RID information (BRID,Section 5.2).  The former RRType is particularly important as it\n   contains a URI (as part of the certificate) that points to Private\n   Information resources.\n\n   DETs, being IPv6 addresses, are to be under ip6.arpa. (nibble\n   reversed per Section 2.5 of RFC 3596 [STD88]) and MUST resolve to an\n   HHIT RRType.  Depending on local circumstances or additional use\n   cases, other RRTypes MAY be present (for example the inclusion of the\n   DS RRTypes or equivalent when using DNSSEC).  For UAS RID, the BRID\n   RRType MUST be present to provide the Broadcast Endorsements (BEs)\n   defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of [RFC9575].\n\n   DNSSEC MUST be used for apex entities (those which use a self-signed\n   Canonical Registration Certificate) and is RECOMMENDED for other\n   entities.  When a DIME decides to use DNSSEC, they SHOULD define a\n   framework for cryptographic algorithms and key management [RFC6841].\n   This may be influenced by the frequency of updates, size of the zone,\n   and policies.\n\n   UAS-specific information, such as physical characteristics, may also\n   be stored in DNS but is out of scope for this document.\n\n   A DET IPv6 address gets mapped into domain names using the scheme\n   defined in Section 2.5 of RFC 3596 [STD88].  However, DNS lookups of\n   these names query for HHIT and/or BRID resource records rather than\n   the PTR resource records conventionally used in reverse lookups of IP\n   addresses.  For example, the HHIT resource record for the DET\n   2001:30::1 would be returned from a DNS lookup for the HHIT QTYPE for\n   1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.a\n   rpa..\n\n   The HHIT RRType provides the public key for signature verification\n   and URIs via the certificate.  The BRID RRType provides static\n   Broadcast RID information such as the Broadcast Endorsements sent as\n   described in [RFC9575].\n\n5. Resource Records\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1. HHIT Resource Record\n\n   The HHIT Resource Record (HHIT, RRType 67) is a metadata record for\n   various bits of HHIT-specific information that isn't available in the\n   pre-existing HIP RRType.  The HHIT RRType does not replace the HIP\n   RRType [RFC8005].  The primary advantage of the HHIT RRType over the\n   existing RRType is the mandatory inclusion of the Canonical\n   Registration Certificate containing an entity's public key signed by\n   the registrar, or other trust anchor, to confirm registration.\n\n   The data MUST be encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation\n   (CBOR) [RFC8949] bytes.  The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)\n   [RFC8610] of the data is provided in Figure 4.\n\n5.1.1. Text Representation\n\n   The data are represented in base64 [RFC4648] and may be divided into\n   any number of white-space-separated substrings, down to single base64\n   digits, which are concatenated to obtain the full object.  These\n   substrings can span lines using the standard parenthesis.  Note that\n   the data has internal subfields but these do not appear in the zone\n   file representation; only a single logical base64 string will appear.\n\n5.1.1.1. Presentation Representation\n\n   The data MAY, for display purposes only, be represented using the\n   Extended Diagnostic Notation as defined in Appendix G of [RFC8610].\n\n\n\n5.1.2. Field Descriptions\n\n   hhit-rr = [\n       hhit-entity-type: uint,\n       hid-abbreviation: tstr .size(15),\n       canonical-registration-cert: bstr\n   ]\n\n                      Figure 4: HHIT Wire Format CDDL\n\n   All fields of the HHIT RRType MUST be included to be properly formed.\n\n   HHIT Entity Type:  The HHIT Entity Type field is a number with values\n      defined in Section 6.2.2.  It is envisioned that there may be many\n      types of HHITs in use.  In some cases, it may be helpful to\n      understand the role of the HHITs in the ecosystem, like that\n      described in [drip-dki ].  This field provides such context.  This\n      field MAY provide a signal of additional information and/or\n      different handling of the data beyond what is defined in this\n      document.\n\n   HID Abbreviation:  The HID Abbreviation field is a string that\n      provides an abbreviation to the HID (Hierarchy ID) structure of a\n      DET for display devices.  The convention for such abbreviations is\n      a matter of local policy.  Absent of such a policy, this field\n      MUST be filled with the four character hexadecimal representations\n      of the RAA and HDA (in that order) with a separator character,\n      such as a space, in between.  For example, a DET with an RAA value\n      of 10 and HDA value of 20 would be abbreviated as: 000A 0014.\n\n   Canonical Registration Certificate:  The Canonical Registration\n      Certificate field is for a certificate-endorsing registration of\n      the DET.  It MUST be encoded as X.509 DER [RFC5280].  This\n      certificate MAY be self-signed when the entity is acting as a root\n      of trust (i.e., an apex).  Such self-signed behavior is defined by\n      policy, such as in [drip-dki ], and is out of scope for this\n      document.  This certificate is part of a chain of certificates\n      that can be used to validate inclusion in the hierarchy.\n\n\n\n5.2. UAS Broadcast RID Resource Record\n\n   The UAS Broadcast RID Resource Record (BRID, RRType 68) is a format\n   to hold information typically sent over UAS Broadcast RID that is\n   static.  It can act as a data source if information is not received\n   over Broadcast RID or for cross validation.  The primary function for\n   DRIP is to include of one or more Broadcast Endorsements as defined\n   in [RFC9575] in the auth field.  These Endorsements are generated by\n   the registrar upon successful registration and broadcast by the\n   entity.\n\n   The data MUST be encoded in CBOR [RFC8949] bytes.  The CDDL [RFC8610]\n   of the data is provided in Figure 5.\n\n5.2.1. Text Representation\n\n   The data are represented in base64 [RFC4648] and may be divided into\n   any number of white-space-separated substrings, down to single base64\n   digits, which are concatenated to obtain the full object.  These\n   substrings can span lines using the standard parenthesis.

DET Prefix Delegation\n\n   The reverse domain for the DET Prefix, i.e., 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.,\n   is managed by IANA.  IANA will liaise, as needed, with the\n   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to verify the\n   authenticity of delegations to CAAs (see Section 6.2.1.4).\n\n\n6.2. IANA DRIP Registry\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1. DRIP RAA Allocations\n\n   IANA has created the registry for RAA Allocations under the \"Drone\n   Remote ID Protocol\" registry group <https://www.iana.org/assignments/\n   drip >.\n\n   RAA Allocations:  a 14-bit value used to represent RAAs.  Future\n      additions to this registry are to be made based on the following\n      range and policy table:\n\n   +===========+======================+================================+\n   | RAA Range | Allocation           | Policy                         |\n   +===========+======================+================================+\n   | 0 - 3     | Reserved             |                                |\n   +-----------+----------------------+--------------------------------+\n   | 4 - 3999  | ISO 3166-1           | IESG Approval (Section 4.10 of |\n   |           | Countries            | [RFC8126]), Section 6.2.1.4    |\n   +-----------+----------------------+--------------------------------+\n   | 4000 -    | Reserved             |                                |\n   | 8191      |                      |                                |\n   +-----------+----------------------+--------------------------------+\n   | 8192 -    | Unassigned           | First Come First Served        |\n   | 15359     |                      | (Section 4.4 of [RFC8126])     |\n   +-----------+----------------------+--------------------------------+\n   | 15360 -   | Private              | Private Use (Section 4.1 of    |\n   | 16383     | Use                  | [RFC8126]), Section 6.2.1.5    |\n   +-----------+----------------------+--------------------------------+\n\n                            Table 1: RAA Ranges\n\n6.2.1.1. RAA Allocation Fields\n\n   Value:  The RAA value delegated for this entry.\n\n   Name:  Name of the delegated RAA.  For the ISO 3166-1 Countries\n      (Section 6.2.1.4), this should be the name of the country.\n\n   Reference:  A publicly accessible link to the policy requirements for\n      prospective HDA operators to register under this RAA.  This field\n      is OPTIONAL.\n\n   Contact:  Contact details of the administrator of this RAA that\n      prospective HDA operators can make informational queries to.\n\n\n6.2.1.2. RAA Registration Form\n\n   Value:\n   Name:\n   Reference:\n   Contact:\n   NS RRType Content (HDA=0):\n   NS RRType Content (HDA=4096):\n   NS RRType Content (HDA=8192):\n   NS RRType Content (HDA=12288):\n\n                   Figure 6: RAA Delegation Request Form\n\n   The NS RRType Content (HDA=X) fields are used by IANA to perform the\n   DNS delegations under 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.. See Section 6.2.1.3   for technical details.\n\n\n6.2.1.3. Handling Nibble Split\n\n   To support DNS delegation in 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa., a single RAA is\n   given 4 delegations by borrowing the upper two bits of HDA space (see\n   Figure 7 for an example).  This enables a clean nibble boundary in\n   the DNS to delegate from (i.e., the prefix 2001:3x:xxx0::/44).  These\n   HDAs (0, 4096, 8192 and 12288) are reserved for the RAA.\n\n 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|           0           | x |         RAA=16376         |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n    0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   E   |   F   |   F     HDA=0,x=00\n    0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   E   |   F   |   F     HDA=4096,x=01\n    0   |   0   |   0   |   2   |   E   |   F   |   F     HDA=8192,x=10\n    0   |   0   |   0   |   3   |   E   |   F   |   F     HDA=12288,x=11\n\n             Figure 7: Example Bit Borrowing of RAA=16376\n\n\n6.2.1.4. ISO 3166-1 Countries Range\n\n   The mapping between ISO 3166-1 Numeric Nation Codes and RAAs is\n   specified and documented by IANA.  Each Nation is assigned 4 RAAs\n   that are left to the national authority for their purpose.  For RAAs\n   under this range, a shorter prefix of 2001:3x:xx00::/40 MAY be\n   delegated to each CAA, which covers all 4 RAAs (and reserved HDAs)\n   assigned to them.\n\n   The registration policy for this range is set to IESG Approval\n   (Section 4.10 of [RFC8126]) and IANA will liaise with the ICAO to\n   verify the authenticity of delegation requests (using Figure 6) by\n   CAAs.\n\n\n6.2.1.5. Private Range\n\n   If nibble-reversed lookup in DNS is desired, it can only be provided\n   by private DNS servers as zone delegations from the global root will\n   not be performed for this address range.  Thus the RAAs (with its\n   subordinate HDAs) in this range may be used in like manner and IANA\n   will not delegate any value in this range to any party (as per\n   Private Use, Section 4.1 of [RFC8126]).\n\n   One anticipated acceptable use of the private range is for\n   experimentation and testing prior to request allocation or assignment\n   from IANA.\n\n\n\n6.2.2. HHIT Entity Types\n\n   This document requests a new registry for HHIT Entity Types under the\n   \"Drone Remote ID Protocol\" registry group\n   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/drip >.\n\n   HHIT Entity Type:  Numeric, field of the HHIT RRType to encode the\n      HHIT Entity Type.  All entries in this registry are under the\n      First Come First Served policy (Section 4.4 of [RFC8126]).\n\n6.2.2.1.

Security Considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1. DNS Operational and Registration Considerations\n\n   The Registrar and Registry are commonly used concepts in the DNS.\n   These components connect the DIME with the DNS hierarchy and thus\n   operation SHOULD follow best common practices, specifically in\n   security (such as running DNSSEC) as appropriate except when national\n   regulations prevent it.  [BCP237] provides suitable guidance.\n\n   If DNSSEC is used, a DNSSEC Practice Statement SHOULD be developed\n   and published.  It SHOULD explain how DNSSEC has been deployed and\n   what security measures are in place.  [RFC6841] documents a framework\n   for DNSSEC policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements.  A self-signed\n   entity (i.e., an entity that self-signed its certificate as part of\n   the HHIT RRType) MUST use DNSSEC.\n\n   The interfaces and protocol specifications for registry-registrar\n   interactions are intentionally not specified in this document.  These\n   will depend on nationally defined policy and prevailing local\n   circumstances.  It is expected that registry-registrar activity will\n   use the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [STD69] or equivalent.\n   The registry SHOULD provide a lookup service such as RDAP [STD95] or\n   equivalent to publish public information about registered domain\n   names.\n\n   Decisions about DNS or registry best practices and other operational\n   matters that influence security SHOULD be made by the CAA, ideally in\n   consultation with local stakeholders.\n\n   The guidance above is intended to reduce the likelihood of\n   interoperability problems and minimize security and stability\n   concerns.  For instance, validation and authentication of DNS\n   responses depends on DNSSEC.  If this is not used, entities using\n   DRIP will be vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks and could be exposed\n   to bogus data.  DRIP DNS responses that have not been validated by\n   DNSSEC could contain bogus data that have the potential to create\n   serious security problems and operational concerns for DRIP entities.\n   These threats include denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks,\n   impersonation or cloning of UAVs, hijacking of DET registrations,\n   injection of corrupt metadata, and compromising established trust\n   architecture/relationships.  Some regulatory and legal considerations\n   are expected to be simplified by providing a lookup service for\n   access to public information about registered domain names for DETs.\n\n   When DNSSEC is not in use, due to the length of the ORCHID hash\n   selected for DETs (Section 3.5 of [RFC9374]), clients MUST \"walk\" the\n   tree of certificates locating each certificate by performing DNS\n   lookups of HHIT RRTypes for each DET verifying inclusion into the\n   hierarchy.  The collection of these certificates (which provide both\n   signature protection from the parent entity and the public key of the\n   entity) is the only way without DNSSEC to prove valid registration.\n\n   The contents of the BRID RRType auth key, containing Endorsements as\n   described in Section 4.2 of [RFC9575], are a shadow of the X.509\n   certificate found in the HHIT RRType.  The validation of these\n   Endorsements follow the guidelines written in Section 6.4.2 of\n   [RFC9575] for Broadcast RID Observers and when present MUST also be\n   validated.\n\n\n7.2. DET and Public Key Exposure\n\n   DETs are built upon asymmetric keys.  As such the public key must be\n   revealed to enable clients to perform signature verifications.\n   [RFC9374] security considerations cover various attacks on such keys.\n   While unlikely, the forging of a corresponding private key is\n   possible if given enough time (and computational power).\n\n   When practical, it is RECOMMENDED that no RRTypes under a DET's\n   specific domain name be published unless and until it is required for\n   use by other parties.  Such action would cause at least the HHIT\n   RRType to not be in the DNS, protecting the public key in the\n   certificate from being exposed before its needed.  The combination of\n   this \"just in time\" publishing mechanism and DNSSEC is out of scope\n   for this document.\n\n   Optimally this requires that the UAS somehow signal to the DIME that\n   a flight using a Specific Session ID will soon be underway or\n   complete.  It may also be facilitated under UTM if the USS (which may\n   or may not be a DIME) signals when a given operation using a Session\n   ID goes active.\n\n\nA. Example Zone Files and RRType Contents\n\n   An example zone file ip6.arpa., run by IANA, is not shown.  It would\n   contain NS RRTypes to delegate to a respective RAA.  To avoid any\n   future collisions with production deployments an apex of\n   ip6.example.com. is used instead of ip6.arpa..

It could add costs and complexity to develop policies\n   and contracts as outlined above.  On the other hand, registries and\n   registrars offer customer service and support and can provide the\n   supporting infrastructure for reliable DNS and RDAP service.\n\n   Another approach could be to handle DRIP registrations in a\n   comparable way to how IP address space gets provisioned.  Here,\n   blocks of addresses get delegated to a \"trusted\" third party,\n   typically an ISP, who then issues IP addresses to its customers.  For\n   DRIP, blocks of IP addresses could be delegated from the\n   3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. domain (reverse domain of prefix allocated by\n   [RFC9374]) to an entity chosen by the appropriate Civil Aviation\n   Authority (CAA).  This third party would be responsible for the\n   corresponding DNS and RDAP infrastructure for these IP address\n   blocks.  They would also provision the HHIT records [RFC9374] for\n   these IP addresses.  In principle, a manufacturer or vendor of UAS\n   devices could provide that role.  This is shown as an example in\n   Figure 3.\n\n   Dynamic DRIP registration is another possible solution, for example\n   when the operator of a UAS device registers its corresponding HHIT\n   record and other resources before a flight and deletes them\n   afterwards.  This may be feasible in controlled environments with\n   well-behaved actors.  However, this approach may not scale since each\n   device is likely to need credentials for updating the IT\n   infrastructure that provisions the DNS.\n\n   Registration policies (pricing, renewals, registrar, and registrant\n   agreements, etc.) will need to be developed.  These considerations\n   should be determined by the CAA, perhaps in consultation with local\n   stakeholders to assess the cost-benefits of these approaches (and\n   others).  All of these are out of scope for this document.  The\n   specifics for the UAS RID use case are detailed in the rest of\n   document.",

This\n   document defines two new RRTypes, one for HHIT metadata (HHIT,Section 5.1) and another for UAS Broadcast RID information (BRID,Section 5.2).  The former RRType is particularly important as it\n   contains a URI (as part of the certificate) that points to Private\n   Information resources.\n\n   DETs, being IPv6 addresses, are to be under ip6.arpa.

Depending on local circumstances or additional use\n   cases, other RRTypes MAY be present (for example the inclusion of the\n   DS RRTypes or equivalent when using DNSSEC).  For UAS RID, the BRID\n   RRType MUST be present to provide the Broadcast Endorsements (BEs)\n   defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of [RFC9575].\n\n   DNSSEC MUST be used for apex entities (those which use a self-signed\n   Canonical Registration Certificate) and is RECOMMENDED for other\n   entities.

It is envisioned that there may be many\n      types of HHITs in use.  In some cases, it may be helpful to\n      understand the role of the HHITs in the ecosystem, like that\n      described in [drip-dki ].  This field provides such context.

Absent of such a policy, this field\n      MUST be filled with the four character hexadecimal representations\n      of the RAA and HDA (in that order) with a separator character,\n      such as a space, in between.  For example, a DET with an RAA value\n      of 10 and HDA value of 20 would be abbreviated as: 000A 0014.\n\n   Canonical Registration Certificate:  The Canonical Registration\n      Certificate field is for a certificate-endorsing registration of\n      the DET.  It MUST be encoded as X.509 DER [RFC5280].  This\n      certificate MAY be self-signed when the entity is acting as a root\n      of trust (i.e., an apex).  Such self-signed behavior is defined by\n      policy, such as in [drip-dki ], and is out of scope for this\n      document.

            "title": "DNS Operational and Registration Considerations",
            "content": "   The Registrar and Registry are commonly used concepts in the DNS.\n   These components connect the DIME with the DNS hierarchy and thus\n   operation SHOULD follow best common practices, specifically in\n   security (such as running DNSSEC) as appropriate except when national\n   regulations prevent it.  [BCP237] provides suitable guidance.\n\n   If DNSSEC is used, a DNSSEC Practice Statement SHOULD be developed\n   and published.  It SHOULD explain how DNSSEC has been deployed and\n   what security measures are in place.  [RFC6841] documents a framework\n   for DNSSEC policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements.  A self-signed\n   entity (i.e., an entity that self-signed its certificate as part of\n   the HHIT RRType) MUST use DNSSEC.\n\n   The interfaces and protocol specifications for registry-registrar\n   interactions are intentionally not specified in this document.  These\n   will depend on nationally defined policy and prevailing local\n   circumstances.  It is expected that registry-registrar activity will\n   use the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [STD69] or equivalent.\n   The registry SHOULD provide a lookup service such as RDAP [STD95] or\n   equivalent to publish public information about registered domain\n   names.\n\n   Decisions about DNS or registry best practices and other operational\n   matters that influence security SHOULD be made by the CAA, ideally in\n   consultation with local stakeholders.\n\n   The guidance above is intended to reduce the likelihood of\n   interoperability problems and minimize security and stability\n   concerns.  For instance, validation and authentication of DNS\n   responses depends on DNSSEC.  If this is not used, entities using\n   DRIP will be vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks and could be exposed\n   to bogus data.  DRIP DNS responses that have not been validated by\n   DNSSEC could contain bogus data that have the potential to create\n   serious security problems and operational concerns for DRIP entities.\n   These threats include denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks,\n   impersonation or cloning of UAVs, hijacking of DET registrations,\n   injection of corrupt metadata, and compromising established trust\n   architecture/relationships.  Some regulatory and legal considerations\n   are expected to be simplified by providing a lookup service for\n   access to public information about registered domain names for DETs.\n\n   When DNSSEC is not in use, due to the length of the ORCHID hash\n   selected for DETs (Section 3.5 of [RFC9374]), clients MUST \"walk\" the\n   tree of certificates locating each certificate by performing DNS\n   lookups of HHIT RRTypes for each DET verifying inclusion into the\n   hierarchy.  The collection of these certificates (which provide both\n   signature protection from the parent entity and the public key of the\n   entity) is the only way without DNSSEC to prove valid registration.\n\n   The contents of the BRID RRType auth key, containing Endorsements as\n   described in Section 4.2 of [RFC9575], are a shadow of the X.509\n   certificate found in the HHIT RRType.  The validation of these\n   Endorsements follow the guidelines written in Section 6.4.2 of\n   [RFC9575] for Broadcast RID Observers and when present MUST also be\n   validated.",

            "content": "   DETs are built upon asymmetric keys.  As such the public key must be\n   revealed to enable clients to perform signature verifications.\n   [RFC9374] security considerations cover various attacks on such keys.\n   While unlikely, the forging of a corresponding private key is\n   possible if given enough time (and computational power).\n\n   When practical, it is RECOMMENDED that no RRTypes under a DET's\n   specific domain name be published unless and until it is required for\n   use by other parties.  Such action would cause at least the HHIT\n   RRType to not be in the DNS, protecting the public key in the\n   certificate from being exposed before its needed.  The combination of\n   this \"just in time\" publishing mechanism and DNSSEC is out of scope\n   for this document.\n\n   Optimally this requires that the UAS somehow signal to the DIME that\n   a flight using a Specific Session ID will soon be underway or\n   complete.  It may also be facilitated under UTM if the USS (which may\n   or may not be a DIME) signals when a given operation using a Session\n   ID goes active.",
