    "excerpt_summary": "Section 2 of RFC 9887 defines terminology for TACACS+ over TLS, including “obfuscation”, “non‑TLS connection”, “TLS connection”, “TLS TACACS+ server”, “peer”, and the BCP 14 requirements language. These terms are meant to align the new TLS usage with the base TACACS+ definitions in RFC 8907.",

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The scoping of “non‑TLS connection” vs “TLS connection” and “TLS TACACS+ server” is straightforward and consistent with later references; no obvious mis-scoping in this section itself."

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The only normative construct is the standard BCP 14 boilerplate in 2.1, which is correctly formed; no conflicting requirements appear in this section."

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No ABNF/YANG/ASN.1 or packet diagrams are defined here; the BCP 14 template matches RFC 8174’s recommended text."
