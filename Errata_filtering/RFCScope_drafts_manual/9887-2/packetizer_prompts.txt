You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 2 of RFC 9887 defines terminology for TACACS+ over TLS, including “obfuscation”, “non‑TLS connection”, “TLS connection”, “TLS TACACS+ server”, “peer”, and the BCP 14 requirements language. These terms are meant to align the new TLS usage with the base TACACS+ definitions in RFC 8907.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Purely definitional; no state machines, timers, or ordering rules are introduced here.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Client/server/peer roles are named but not used in any procedural or message-flow logic in this section.
  - Scope: LOW - The scoping of “non‑TLS connection” vs “TLS connection” and “TLS TACACS+ server” is straightforward and consistent with later references; no obvious mis-scoping in this section itself.
  - Causal: LOW - No algorithms or cause→effect processing are specified; just definitions.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Port numbers (49 and the upcoming “new well-known port” concept) are mentioned at a high level and appear consistent with RFC 8907 and later sections.
  - Deontic: LOW - The only normative construct is the standard BCP 14 boilerplate in 2.1, which is correctly formed; no conflicting requirements appear in this section.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/ASN.1 or packet diagrams are defined here; the BCP 14 template matches RFC 8174’s recommended text.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References (RFC 8907 Section 3, 10.5.2; BCP 14) are slightly informal but not incorrect in a way that affects protocol behavior; at most editorial nitpicks.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terms are clearly defined and used consistently within this section; “TLS TACACS+ server” is well-scoped, and “peer” is symmetric.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behaviors or limits are discussed here; just general definitions.
