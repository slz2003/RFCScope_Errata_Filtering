You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 13 specifies how a DHCPv6 server chooses IPv6 addresses for IA_NA and prefixes for IA_PD, including how it determines the client’s link (direct vs via relay), privacy‑friendly address generation, and avoidance of reserved interface identifiers; prefix selection mechanisms are left to server policy with some examples.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - The text is about selection criteria, not sequencing or timers.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Roles (server, relay, client) are clear and consistent with earlier sections and referenced RFCs.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope (IA_NA vs IA_PD, server-side behavior) is explicit; PD selection is intentionally left to implementation/policy.
  - Causal: LOW - Following the specified rules yields coherent behavior; no obvious cause→effect contradictions in address/prefix selection.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No non-trivial numeric ranges or size calculations here beyond referencing reserved IID ranges in other RFCs.
  - Deontic: LOW - Normative language (e.g., MUST NOT use reserved IIDs, SHOULD NOT generate predictable addresses) is consistent with referenced privacy BCPs and does not conflict with other parts of the excerpt.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/bitfield structures in this section; only prose requirements.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 6221, 7721, 7824, 7707, 7943, 5453, 7136, 7969, 3162 are context-appropriate and appear aligned with how those documents define relaying, privacy, and reserved IIDs.
  - Terminology: LOW - Use of IA_NA, IA_PD, DUID, link-address, etc., matches definitions earlier in the draft and in referenced RFCs.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge cases (e.g., multiple Relay-forward layers, zero link-address, reserved IIDs) are explicitly mentioned and handled; no obvious missing edge behavior visible within this section.
