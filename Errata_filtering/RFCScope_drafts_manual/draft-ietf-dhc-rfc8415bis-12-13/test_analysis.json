    "excerpt_summary": "Section 13 specifies how a DHCPv6 server chooses IPv6 addresses for IA_NA and prefixes for IA_PD, including how it determines the client’s link (direct vs via relay), privacy‑friendly address generation, and avoidance of reserved interface identifiers; prefix selection mechanisms are left to server policy with some examples.",

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Normative language (e.g., MUST NOT use reserved IIDs, SHOULD NOT generate predictable addresses) is consistent with referenced privacy BCPs and does not conflict with other parts of the excerpt."
