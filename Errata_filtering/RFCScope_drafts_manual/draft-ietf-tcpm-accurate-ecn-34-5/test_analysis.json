        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Compatibility text references handshakes and retransmissions, but does not introduce new sequencing rules beyond those normatively defined earlier."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Roles (client/server, sender/receiver) are used consistently and mainly restate earlier normative behavior."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Section 5 is explicitly informative; it stays within the intended scope of “interaction/compatibility” and doesn’t silently redefine normative behavior."

      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Described interactions (e.g., with SYN cookies, TFO, ConEx) are high-level and do not create obvious impossible or self-contradictory behaviors when literally implemented."

        "explanation": "No new numeric ranges, counters, or sizes are defined here; it only refers back to earlier-defined fields and counters."

      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Only a few SHOULD/MAY in this section, and they are clearly advisory and not in tension with the normative rules in Section 3 or the referenced RFCs."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No new ABNF, diagrams, or formal structures are introduced here; just prose about interactions."
