      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Section 9 is largely about static requirements, not message ordering or timing."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Requirements are mostly symmetric “TLS-compliant application” obligations, not subtle role inversions."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The normative scope (TLS 1.3 vs “earlier versions” vs “application profile may override”) is explicit and internally consistent."

      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No algorithmic steps here whose literal implementation would make the protocol unexecutable or insecure; it’s capability requirements, not procedures."

      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No tricky ranges, sizes, or counters in this section; cipher/group identifiers are consistent with earlier definitions."

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The MUST/SHOULD/MAY usage tightens requirements compared to RFC 8446 but does not conflict with earlier normative text in this draft."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No new ABNF/YANG/ASN.1; the referenced identifiers (cipher suites, extensions, SignatureScheme, NamedGroup) match the definitions in Sections 4 and B."

      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to RFC 6066, 7748, 8439, 5116, and GCM are aligned with how those RFCs define server_name, X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and AES-GCM."
