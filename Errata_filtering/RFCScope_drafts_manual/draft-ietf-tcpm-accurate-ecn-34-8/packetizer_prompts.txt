You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 8 discusses security and privacy considerations of AccECN, focusing on resilience under ACK loss, integrity of congestion feedback, covert-channel capacity of AccECN options, and privacy/fingerprinting implications (including VPN scenarios and SYN-flood/SYN-cookie interactions).
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Mostly static security properties; no message ordering or timer logic is specified here beyond referencing earlier sections.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Roles (Data Sender/Receiver, attacker, middlebox) are clear and consistent with earlier sections; no confusion over who does what.
  - Scope: LOW - The section speaks at a high level about “AccECN Data Sender/Receiver”, options, and VPN scenarios without redefining scope-dependent rules.
  - Causal: LOW - It qualitatively describes possible attacks and mitigations, but does not introduce new algorithmic behaviors that could conflict with earlier causal chains.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Only trivial arithmetic (e.g., 29-byte covert channel) appears, which is consistent with the 40-byte TCP option space and 11-byte minimum AccECN option.
  - Deontic: LOW - Security text references earlier normative requirements (e.g., conservative ACE handling) in a descriptive way; no new or conflicting RFC2119 requirements are introduced.
  - Structural: LOW - No new ABNF/YANG/diagrams beyond simple references; nothing to cross-check structurally.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to integrity approaches, SYN flooding, VPNs, etc., are conceptually compatible with cited RFCs; no mismatched section numbers or misdescribed mechanisms are evident.
  - Terminology: LOW - Uses previously defined terms (AccECN, ACE, AccECN Options, Data Sender/Receiver) consistently with earlier sections.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge cases (e.g., stripped options, long ACK-loss runs, VPN scenarios) are discussed qualitatively, but no new edge-condition behaviors are specified that might contradict earlier text.
