    "excerpt_summary": "Section 8 discusses security and privacy considerations of AccECN, focusing on resilience under ACK loss, integrity of congestion feedback, covert-channel capacity of AccECN options, and privacy/fingerprinting implications (including VPN scenarios and SYN-flood/SYN-cookie interactions).",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Mostly static security properties; no message ordering or timer logic is specified here beyond referencing earlier sections."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Roles (Data Sender/Receiver, attacker, middlebox) are clear and consistent with earlier sections; no confusion over who does what."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The section speaks at a high level about “AccECN Data Sender/Receiver”, options, and VPN scenarios without redefining scope-dependent rules."

      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "It qualitatively describes possible attacks and mitigations, but does not introduce new algorithmic behaviors that could conflict with earlier causal chains."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Only trivial arithmetic (e.g., 29-byte covert channel) appears, which is consistent with the 40-byte TCP option space and 11-byte minimum AccECN option."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Security text references earlier normative requirements (e.g., conservative ACE handling) in a descriptive way; no new or conflicting RFC2119 requirements are introduced."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No new ABNF/YANG/diagrams beyond simple references; nothing to cross-check structurally."

      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to integrity approaches, SYN flooding, VPNs, etc., are conceptually compatible with cited RFCs; no mismatched section numbers or misdescribed mechanisms are evident."

      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",

      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Edge cases (e.g., stripped options, long ACK-loss runs, VPN scenarios) are discussed qualitatively, but no new edge-condition behaviors are specified that might contradict earlier text."

        "sketch_for_experts": "The security/privacy section accurately references the normative behavior defined earlier (e.g., conservative ACE handling per §3.2.2.5 and Appendix A.2, SYN-cookie behavior per §5.1, and integrity mechanisms per §5.3). The calculations (such as the 29-byte potential covert channel) check out against the defined option format and TCP option space. Apparent tensions—e.g., stating that AccECN does not introduce new privacy concerns while later noting it can aid correlation across VPNs—are interpretive and do not affect protocol behavior or interoperability; they would at most warrant editorial clarification, not a protocol erratum."
