### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ScopeAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 2 gives an *informative* (non‑normative) description of AccECN’s two‑part feedback scheme (ACE field and byte‑count options), how counters are used, and the idea of a “generic reflector” for ECN markings including on SYN/SYN‑ACK. It is intended as a high‑level preview of the detailed rules in Section 3.

- ScopeModel:
  - Targets:
    - Per half‑connection, a Data Receiver’s four counters:
      - Three byte counters for payload bytes marked CE / ECT(1) / ECT(0) in the IP‑ECN field.
      - One packet counter for packets marked CE (described as including control packets without payload).
    - A Data Sender’s four “equivalent” counters intended to track the receiver’s values.
    - The ACE field (3 bits in the TCP header) as the on‑the‑wire representation of the CE packet counter.
    - AccECN TCP options as on‑the‑wire representations of the three byte counters.
    - “Control packets”, including pure ACKs and (by common TCP terminology) SYN / SYN‑ACK.
    - Special treatment of initial SYN and SYN/ACK as “most critical control packets” whose ECN is also fed back.
  - Conditions:
    - AccECN’s counters and ACE semantics are only used once both endpoints have negotiated AccECN during the three‑way handshake.
    - Normative Section 3 later constrains r.cep / ACE more narrowly: for “Acceptable” packets, excluding CE on SYN (SYN=1, ACK=0), and with special handshake rules for SYN/ACK.
    - The ACE field is normatively defined only on segments with SYN=0 when AccECN has been successfully negotiated; SYN/SYN‑ACK use a different handshake encoding.
  - NotedAmbiguities:
    - Section 2.2 describes the CE packet counter as counting “the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked)” with no mention of the later SYN exclusion.
    - Section 2.5 says “The ACE field provides feedback about CE markings in the IP‑ECN field of both data and control packets,” while Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.2.1 later explicitly exclude SYN=1 segments from ACE semantics and use a separate handshake encoding.
    - Section 2 does not signal that SYN / SYN‑ACK are treated as a special sub‑class of “control packets” for counter accounting; that distinction only appears in Section 3.

- CandidateIssues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Overview claims CE packet counter covers all CE‑marked packets/control packets, but normative text excludes CE on SYN and applies special handshake rules
    - ScopeProblemType: Over‑broad informal scope for the CE packet counter (r.cep) relative to the formal per‑packet counting rules in Section 3
    - Evidence:
      - Section 2.2: “The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked).”
      - Section 3.2: “The Data Receiver MUST increment the CE packet counter (r.cep), for every Acceptable packet that it receives with the CE code point in the IP ECN field, including CE marked control packets and retransmissions **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).**”
      - Section 3.2.2.2 (handshake exceptions): “If a TCP Server in AccECN mode receives a CE mark in the IP‑ECN field of a SYN (SYN=1, ACK=0), it MUST NOT increment r.cep (it remains at its initial value of 5).” and “If a TCP Client in AccECN mode receives a CE mark in the IP‑ECN field of a SYN/ACK, it MUST increment r.cep, but no more than once…”  
    - DetailedReasoning:
      - Section 2.2 describes the CE packet counter in simple, global terms: it “counts the number of packets” with CE, explicitly including control packets. There is no qualifier here that any class of CE‑marked packets is *excluded* from the count.
      - In the normative spec, Section 3.2 tightens the scope: r.cep is incremented for CE on Acceptable packets (including control and retransmissions) **but explicitly not for CE on SYN packets**. For CE on SYN/ACK, there is a further special case that allows at most one increment of r.cep regardless of how many CE‑marked SYN/ACKs are received.
      - Those handshake exceptions are not just cosmetic: the initial non‑zero values of r.cep/s.cep (5/5) and their controlled first increment(s) are used in handshake semantics, stateless‑cookie handling, and reserved codepoints for future variants (see Tables 2–4 and Section 3.2.2.1/3.2.2.2). Counting every CE‑marked SYN/SYN‑ACK into r.cep, as Section 2.2’s wording suggests, would consume those initial values unpredictably and break the intended handshake signalling space.
      - From a scope standpoint, Section 2’s informal description makes r.cep sound like “CE on **all** packets,” whereas Section 3 limits its domain in time (handshake vs established), by flag (SYN=1 vs 0), and by per‑event rules (only one increment for arbitrarily many CE‑marked SYN/ACKs).
      - Because Section 2 is marked as informative, the normative behaviour is ultimately unambiguous if implementers read Section 3 carefully. However, Section 2.2 is detailed enough that an implementer might rely on it for the mental model of what “the CE packet counter” covers, and not realise that SYN CE is a deliberate exception.
      - The resulting mismatch is a classic scope issue: the overview text assigns the counter a broader domain (“all CE‑marked packets, including control”) than the normative rules actually do (“Acceptable CE‑marked packets except SYN, plus a single bounded contribution from SYN/ACK via special rules”).
      - A minimal erratum or clarification in Section 2.2—e.g., explicitly noting that SYN/SYN‑ACK have special‑case handling described later, and that CE on SYN is not included in the generic CE packet counter—would align the informative scope with the normative one and reduce the risk of misimplementation.

  - Issue-2:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Overview attributes generic CE feedback on all data/control packets to the ACE field, despite ACE being undefined on SYN/SYN‑ACK
    - ScopeProblemType: Mis-scoped statement about where the ACE field applies (all “data and control packets” vs “only non‑SYN segments in AccECN mode, with separate handshake encoding for SYN/SYN‑ACK”)
    - Evidence:
      - Section 2.5: “The ACE field provides feedback about CE markings in the IP‑ECN field of both data and control packets.”
      - Immediately following in Section 2.5: “The initial SYN and SYN/ACK are the most critical control packets, so AccECN feeds back their IP‑ECN fields.”
      - Section 3.2.2: “a host with both of its half‑connections in AccECN mode MUST interpret the AE, CWR and ECE flags as the 3‑bit ACE counter on a segment with the SYN flag cleared (SYN=0)… A host MUST NOT interpret the 3 flags as a 3-bit ACE field on any segment with SYN=1 (whether ACK is 0 or 1), or if AccECN negotiation is incomplete or has not succeeded.”
      - Section 3.2.2.1: defines a separate “handshake encoding” of those bits on the ACK of the SYN/ACK, which is explicitly “the only exception to the rule that the ACE field carries the 3 least significant bits of the r.cep counter on packets with SYN=0.”
    - DetailedReasoning:
      - Section 2.5 opens by stating that “The ACE field provides feedback about CE markings … of both data and control packets.” In ordinary TCP terminology, SYN and SYN/ACK are core “control packets,” so this sentence reads naturally as applying ACE semantics to them too.
      - However, Section 3.2.2 sharply limits the scope of ACE: it only exists as a 3‑bit CE counter on segments with SYN=0 after AccECN negotiation; on segments with SYN=1, *those same bits* are either part of the legacy ECN negotiation (SYN/SYN‑ACK) or are used with the special handshake encoding on the ACK of the SYN/ACK. On SYN/SYN‑ACK, the ACE semantics are explicitly forbidden.
      - The next sentence in Section 2.5 (“The initial SYN and SYN/ACK are the most critical control packets, so AccECN feeds back their IP‑ECN fields”) implicitly acknowledges that they are handled specially, but it no longer attributes that feedback specifically to the ACE field; instead, it talks generically about “AccECN.” That partially corrects the previous over‑broad statement, but only implicitly.
      - In effect, Section 2.5 first assigns ACE a domain of “all data and control packets,” then silently narrows that for SYN/SYN‑ACK in later sections, where ACE is *not* applicable and a distinct encoding applies. This is a scope inversion: the overview describes a single uniform mechanism (ACE) where the normative spec has two mechanisms with a clear boundary (ACE vs handshake‑encoding).
      - Practically, a careful implementer who follows Section 3 will not put ACE semantics on SYN/SYN‑ACK, because the “MUST NOT interpret … as ACE … on any segment with SYN=1” language is very clear. The risk here is more conceptual: Section 2.5 encourages people to think that “ACE covers all packets,” obscuring the important fact that handshake packets are outside ACE’s scope and have separate rules.
      - That conceptual confusion feeds back into the first issue: if one believes ACE is the universal mechanism for all control packets, one is more likely to mis‑understand (or overlook) the handshake exceptions in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.2.1–3.2.2.2, and to mis‑scope the CE counters during the SYN/SYN‑ACK phase.
      - A small wording change in Section 2.5 would resolve this, e.g., “The AccECN mechanisms provide feedback about CE markings in the IP‑ECN field of both data and control packets. For established‑state data and control packets with SYN=0, this is via the ACE field; for the initial SYN and SYN/ACK, separate handshake encodings described in Section 3.1/3.2.2.1 are used.” That would bring the overview’s stated scope of ACE into line with the formal scope in Section 3.

- ResidualUncertainties:
  - Because Section 2 is explicitly labelled “informative,” these inconsistencies are unlikely to cause wire‑level interoperability failures so long as implementers base behaviour on Section 3. The question for errata is therefore whether the IESG considers misleading scope in a non‑normative overview significant enough to correct. The suggested fixes are small clarifications rather than changes to normative behaviour.

## Causal Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Summary**

There is no fundamental protocol breakage here. The “overview” text in Section 2.2 is slightly looser than the normative rules in Section 3, but the normative text is internally coherent and explicitly special‑cases SYN/SYN‑ACK. An implementation that follows Section 3 as intended will behave correctly; the discrepancy is editorial, not a causal inconsistency.

---

2. **Causal Analysis**

- **What Section 2.2 says (informative)**  
  It describes the four counters and says the 4th “counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked).”  
  This is a high‑level description: “including control packets” is illustrative, not a complete formal definition, and Section 2 is labeled as “informative overview”.

- **What Section 3.2 / 3.2.2 actually require (normative)**  
  The normative rules are:

  - Data Receiver CE packet counter:
    - “MUST increment … for every Acceptable packet … with the CE code point … including CE marked control packets and retransmissions **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).**”
  - Handshake exceptions:
    - If the **Server** sees CE in IP on the SYN, it **MUST NOT** increment `r.cep`. Instead, it only reflects the SYN’s ECN state via the SYN/ACK TCP flags (Table 2).
    - If the **Client** sees CE feedback about the SYN in the SYN/ACK’s TCP flags, it **MUST NOT** increment `s.cep` but still performs congestion response.
    - If the **Client** sees CE in IP on the SYN/ACK, it increments `r.cep` exactly once (from 5 → 6), and uses the special handshake ACE encoding on the ACK of the SYN/ACK to tell the Server; the Server then sets `s.cep` accordingly.

  After the handshake, ACE is used as a straight 3‑bit counter for CE‑marked packets (excluding SYN), and `s.cep` tracks `r.cep`.

- **Why the SYN exclusion is needed**

  The handshake uses special encodings in the SYN/ACK and ACK‑of‑SYN/ACK to:

  * Reliably feed back ECN on SYN and SYN/ACK (which are control packets) independent of the ACE counter.
  * Preserve specific initial values of `r.cep`/`s.cep` (5 or 6) so those values can be used for versioning and for detecting zeroing/mangling, and to avoid double‑counting the same CE event in both handshake encoding and counters.

  If you *ignored* the normative text and also incremented `r.cep` on a CE‑marked SYN:

  - On the client→server half‑connection, the Server’s `r.cep` would move from 5→6 due to the SYN.
  - The Client’s `s.cep` is explicitly required to stay at 5 when it decodes the SYN’s ECN feedback from the SYN/ACK flags.
  - On the first post‑handshake ACK, the ACE field would reflect `r.cep = 6`, and the Client would infer one “new” CE‑marked packet from counters (on top of the already‑handled CE information from the handshake).

  That would cause an *extra* CE event to be counted, potentially leading to one extra congestion response for the same network event. That’s undesirable but **only** occurs if the implementer violates Section 3.2 / 3.2.2.2.

  If Section 3 is followed as written:

  - CE on SYN is relayed solely via the SYN/ACK flags as a one‑off handshake signal.
  - CE on SYN/ACK is counted exactly once via both handshake ACE encoding and `r.cep`/`s.cep`.
  - Post‑handshake ACE and `r.cep`/`s.cep` start from consistent values and count only the intended set of packets.

- **Does Section 2.2’s wording force the wrong behavior?**

  No:

  - Section 2 is explicitly described as “informative overview of the AccECN protocol … normatively specified in Section 3”.
  - “Including control packets” is non‑exclusive language; it doesn’t say “all CE‑marked control packets, including SYN”. The SYN exception is a subtle special case that’s then spelled out in Section 3.
  - An implementer who respects the normal RFC structure (informative vs normative) will take the exact increment rules from Section 3, not from Section 2’s prose summary.

  Therefore, the protocol as specified by the normative sections is **self‑consistent and executable**, and the handshake/counter logic works as intended.

---

3. **Problem Classification**

- This is **not** a Causal Inconsistency or Causal Underspecification.
- It is an **editorial / clarity mismatch** between an informative overview sentence and the more precise normative rules.

The protocol’s actual algorithm (per Section 3) is implementable and does not lead to impossible states or broken interoperability.

---

4. **Minimal Fix Shape (Optional)**

If the authors want to tighten the overview, they could change the Section 2.2 sentence to something like:

> “The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including CE‑marked control packets without payload), **except for SYN packets, which are handled specially during the handshake (see Section 3.2.2.2).**”

This would align the overview with the normative special casing and avoid any impression that SYNs are included.

---

5. **Non‑Issues**

- There is no contradiction inside the normative text: Section 3.2 and 3.2.2 explicitly define the SYN/SYN‑ACK behavior, and all later algorithms (ACE decoding, safety against wrap, handshake integrity, future extension space) remain coherent under those rules.
- The only risk is an implementer who ignores the explicit statement that Section 3 is normative and implements from Section 2 alone. That would be non‑compliant with the RFC’s own structure, not a defect in the protocol design itself.

## Deontic Expert

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DeonticAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 2 gives an explicitly “informative overview” of AccECN (ACE bits, byte counters, delayed‑ACK logic, and generic reflection, including SYN/SYN‑ACK handling). Section 3 then contains the actual RFC 2119 requirements that precisely define when counters are incremented, how handshake semantics work, and how options are used and tested.

- OverallDeonticRisk: None

- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: None
    - Title: Informative overview slightly overgeneralizes CE counting and option usage, but normative rules are coherent
    - Description:
      The main apparent tension is between the Section 2 overview and the later normative text, not between two sets of normative requirements. In Section 2.2, the overview says: “The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked).” This reads as if *all* CE‑marked packets are counted, which would include SYNs. Later, the actual normative rule in Section 3.2 tightens this: “The Data Receiver MUST increment the CE packet counter (r.cep), for every Acceptable packet that it receives with the CE code point … including CE marked control packets and retransmissions, **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).**” The byte‑count rule similarly excludes payload on SYN packets. This is deliberate and is wired into the handshake and initial counter semantics elsewhere in Section 3.2.2 and Tables 2–4. However, Section 2 is explicitly declared “informative” and does not use RFC 2119 language; Section 3.2 carries the binding “MUST”/“MUST NOT” requirements. So there is no contradiction between two normative requirements; the normative story is: CE on SYN is fed back via special handshake encoding, not via r.cep. Likewise, other Section 2 statements with an absolute tone (e.g., “The TCP Server sends an AccECN Option on the SYN/ACK and the TCP Client sends one on the first ACK…” or “The Data Receiver is not allowed to delay sending an ACK to such an extent that the ACE field would cycle.”) are later formalized in Section 3 with appropriate RFC 2119 strengths (e.g., “SHOULD include… MAY omit due to lack of space or cached path knowledge” for options, and the ‘n MUST be no greater than 7’ rule for ACK emission). The binding normative requirements are consistent and implementable; the overview is just slightly looser and omits some edge‑case exclusions, but it does not create a deontic inconsistency because it is non‑normative by construction.
    - KeyTextSnippets:
      - “Section 2 gives an informative overview of the AccECN protocol. Then Section 3 gives the normative protocol specification…”
      - “The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked).”
      - “The Data Receiver MUST increment the CE packet counter (r.cep)… including CE marked control packets and retransmissions, **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).**”
      - “A TCP Server that confirms its support for AccECN… SHOULD include an AccECN TCP Option on the SYN/ACK.”
      - “A TCP Client that has successfully negotiated AccECN SHOULD include an AccECN Option in the first ACK… A host MAY omit an AccECN Option in any of the above three cases…”
      - “Increment-Triggered ACKs: … ‘n’ SHOULD be 2… ‘n’ SHOULD be 3 and MUST be no less than 3. In either case, ‘n’ MUST be no greater than 7.”
    - Impact:
      From a purely normative standpoint, there is no error: implementers who follow Section 3’s MUST/SHOULD/MAY rules will all behave consistently and interoperate. The Section 2 wording could, in theory, mislead someone who reads only the overview and not the normative section, but it does not alter or contradict the actual obligations. Any fix here would be editorial (e.g., mentioning the SYN exception in the overview or softening “sends” to “typically sends”), not a change to the protocol’s deontic structure.

- IfNoRealIssue:
  The apparent tensions the router highlighted are between high‑level, explicitly informative prose in Section 2 and the later formal RFC 2119 text. The latter cleanly and unambiguously defines who MUST do what and when, including the special SYN/SYN‑ACK handling and counter initializations, and there are no conflicting MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT requirements across sections.

## Structural Expert

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AnalysisSummary:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 2 gives an informal description of the AccECN counters and ACE field; Section 3 later gives the precise normative definitions of those counters and the special handshake behavior.
- OverallBugLikelihood: Medium

Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Overview misstates scope of CE packet counter vs. normative definition (SYN packets)
    - LocationHint: Section 2.2 (“Feedback Mechanism”) vs. Section 3.2 / 3.2.2
    - Evidence:
      - Snippet1: Section 2.2 says: “A Data Receiver maintains four counters… Three count the number of arriving payload bytes marked CE, ECT(1) and ECT(0)… The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked).”
      - Snippet2: Section 3.2 normatively defines r.cep as: “The Data Receiver MUST increment the CE packet counter (r.cep), for every Acceptable packet that it receives with the CE code point in the IP ECN field, including CE marked control packets and retransmissions but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).” Later, Section 3.2.2.2 further emphasizes that CE on the SYN and SYN/ACK is handled via special handshake encodings rather than normal counter increments.
    - TechnicalExplanation: |
        Section 2.2’s overview text describes the fourth counter as counting “the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE‑marked)” without any exception. Read literally, this says “all CE‑marked packets”, and explicitly calls out control packets without payloads, which includes SYNs. The normative specification in Section 3.2 deliberately excludes CE on SYN packets (SYN=1, ACK=0) from r.cep, and instead feeds back CE on SYN and SYN/ACK via the special handshake encodings in Table 2/Table 3 and the ACE “handshake encoding” in Section 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2. This exclusion is structurally important: it preserves the special initial values of r.cep/s.cep used for stateless handshakes and reserved ACE codepoints, and avoids double‑counting handshake marks. Thus the overview’s statement of what the “fourth counter” counts is slightly broader than, and therefore inconsistent with, the actual field and counter semantics that are normatively specified. An implementer relying only on Section 2 might incorrectly increment r.cep for CE‑marked SYNs, leading to divergence between endpoints’ counters and violation of the handshake design.
    - PatchSuggestion: |
        Update the Section 2.2 overview sentence to align with the later normative definition by explicitly carving out the SYN exception and mentioning the special handshake handling. For example, replace:
        
          “The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE-marked).”
        
        with something along the lines of:
        
          “The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including CE-marked control packets without payload), **excluding CE marks on the initial SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0), which are instead fed back via the special handshake encoding described later in Section 3.2.2.1 and Table 2.**”
        
        Optionally, add a brief parenthetical note that Section 3 contains the authoritative, detailed definition of exactly which packets contribute to each counter.

  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - Severity: Medium
    - ShortLabel: Overview misdescribes what the CE packet/byte counters cover, omitting the SYN/SYN‑ACK exceptions
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 2.2 (overview of counters):  
          “A Data Receiver maintains four counters initialized at the start of the half‑connection. Three count the number of arriving payload bytes marked CE, ECT(1) and ECT(0) in the IP‑ECN field. These byte counters reflect only the TCP payload length, excluding the TCP header and TCP options. The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE‑marked).”
      - ContextSnippets:
        - Section 3.2 (normative definition of counters):  
          “*The Data Receiver MUST increment the CE packet counter (r.cep), for every Acceptable packet that it receives with the CE code point in the IP ECN field, including CE marked control packets and retransmissions **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).***”  
          “*…MUST increment the r.ceb, r.e0b or r.e1b byte counters … including any payload octets on control packets and retransmissions, **but not including any payload octets on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).***”
        - Section 3.2.1 (initial values rationale):  
          “Non‑zero initial values are used to support a stateless handshake (see Section 5.1) and to be distinct from cases where the fields are incorrectly zeroed…”
        - Section 3.2.2.2 (handshake special cases):  
          “If a TCP Server in AccECN mode receives a CE mark in the IP‑ECN field of a SYN (SYN=1, ACK=0), it MUST NOT increment r.cep (it remains at its initial value of 5). … Incrementing r.cep ensures the Client will eventually deliver any CE marking to the Server reliably … The Client does not increment r.cep more than once, because the Server can only increment s.cep once…”
    - Reasoning:
      - Section 2 is explicitly “an informative overview”, and it introduces the same conceptual entities that Section 3 defines normatively: three byte counters and a packet‑based CE counter (r.cep). In Section 2.2, that “fourth counter” is described as counting “the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE‑marked)” and the byte counters as counting “payload bytes … excluding the TCP header and TCP options.”
      - This overview text is naturally read as “count all CE‑marked packets” (including control packets like SYNs) and “count all TCP payload bytes,” because no exceptions are mentioned. Many implementers will recognize SYN and SYN/ACK as control packets, and pure SYNs normally have no payload – so the parenthetical “including control packets without payload” encourages the interpretation that *all* CE‑marked control packets are covered, with no handshake‑specific carve‑outs.
      - The normative text in Section 3, however, *intentionally* excludes CE‑marked SYNs and SYN payload from these counters:
        - r.cep “MUST … [include CE‑marked control packets] **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0)**.”
        - The byte counters must exclude any payload octets on SYN packets.
        - Section 3.2.2.2 then gives special handshake rules that rely on these exclusions and on the initial values r.cep = 5 / s.cep = 5 to encode and interpret CE on SYN/SYN‑ACK using the handshake‑specific encodings in Tables 2–4, without consuming extra counter states.
      - Thus, the *same conceptual thing* — the CE packet counter / “fourth counter” — is described inconsistently: the overview text implies it counts every CE‑marked packet (including SYNs), whereas the normative text defines it to *exclude* CE on SYN and any SYN payload. The same applies to the byte counters: the overview says they “reflect only the TCP payload length” (with no declared exception for SYN data), but the normative text explicitly excludes SYN payload bytes.
      - Because the overview section is widely read as the first high‑level spec for implementers, this mismatch can plausibly mislead a reader who skims Section 2 and then codes counters accordingly, especially given the overview’s explicit mention of “control packets”. Such an implementation would diverge from the normative behavior in Section 3.2 and could break:
        - the carefully defined handshake semantics and initial values used in Tables 2–4 and Section 3.2.2.2; and
        - any future variants that rely on those reserved initial counter values for negotiation.
      - Although Section 3 is clearly labelled as normative and does override Section 2, the terminology/description of what the “fourth counter” / r.cep covers is materially inconsistent between the two sections. This is more than stylistic: it changes which packets are supposed to be counted under that term.
      - For that reason, this is a real (if non‑fatal) spec inconsistency worth correcting via an erratum, to avoid divergent interpretations between the overview and the normative text.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - Clarify Section 2.2 so that its description of the counters matches the normative rules and explicitly flags the handshake exception. For example:
        - Replace:
          - “Three count the number of arriving payload bytes marked CE, ECT(1) and ECT(0) in the IP‑ECN field. These byte counters reflect only the TCP payload length, excluding the TCP header and TCP options. The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE‑marked).”
        - With text along the following lines:
          - “Three count the number of arriving payload bytes marked CE, ECT(1) and ECT(0) in the IP‑ECN field. These byte counters reflect only the TCP payload length, excluding the TCP header and TCP options, and *excluding any payload on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0)*. The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including CE‑marked control packets without payload), *except that CE marks on initial SYN packets are handled specially during the handshake and are not counted here (see Section 3.2 and Section 3.2.2.2 for the normative definition).*”
      - Optionally add a short forward reference at the end of Section 2.2:  
        “Special rules apply for SYN and SYN‑ACK packets during the three‑way handshake; these are defined normatively in Section 3.2.”

- Notes:
  - UsedRouterIssues: Confirmed the router’s Candidate Issue about Section 2.2 vs Section 3.2: the overview’s description of what the “fourth counter” counts is broader than, and therefore inconsistent with, the normative definition that excludes CE‑marked SYNs and SYN payload.
  - NewIssuesFromExpert: false
  - Limitations:
    - Analysis is based solely on the provided draft text. I did not cross‑check against external errata or later RFC versions; if the final RFC has already adjusted the Section 2 wording, this issue may already have been fixed there.

## Boundary Expert

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BoundaryAnalysis:
- ExcerptUnderstanding: Section 2 is an informative overview of AccECN. It introduces four counters per half‑connection (three byte counters for CE/ECT(0)/ECT(1) and one packet counter for CE), the 3‑bit ACE field, optional byte‑count options, and generic reflection of all ECN markings including on SYN/SYN‑ACK. Section 3 then gives the precise normative rules, including special‑case treatment of CE on SYN/SYN‑ACK and non‑zero counter initialization to support stateless handshakes and middlebox‑detection.
- OverallBoundaryBugLikelihood: Low

- Findings:
  - Finding-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Overview omits SYN/SYN‑ACK exceptions for CE counters
    - BoundaryAxis: Handling of CE on SYN / SYN‑ACK vs “all CE‑marked packets”; treatment of payload bytes on SYN
    - ExcerptEvidence:
      - Section 2.2 (overview) describes the counters as:
        - “Three [counters] count the number of arriving payload bytes marked CE, ECT(1) and ECT(0) in the IP‑ECN field. These byte counters reflect only the TCP payload length, excluding the TCP header and TCP options. The fourth counter counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets without payload if they are CE‑marked).”
      - The normative definition in Section 3.2 refines this:
        - “The Data Receiver MUST increment the CE packet counter (r.cep), for every Acceptable packet that it receives with the CE code point in the IP ECN field, including CE marked control packets and retransmissions **but excluding CE on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).**”
        - “MUST increment the r.ceb, r.e0b or r.e1b byte counters… including any payload octets on control packets and retransmissions, **but not including any payload octets on SYN packets (SYN=1; ACK=0).**”
      - Later handshake rules depend critically on this exclusion, e.g., the special ACE “handshake encoding” and fixed initial values (r.cep/s.cep = 5 or 6) in Tables 3–4 and Section 3.2.2.2.
    - Reasoning:
      - From the overview alone, a reader would reasonably infer that:
        - The CE packet counter counts every CE‑marked packet, including all control packets, with no exception for SYN or SYN‑ACK.
        - The byte counters count payload bytes in every packet, with no carve‑out for payload carried on SYN (e.g., TFO).
      - However, the normative text in Section 3.2 explicitly makes *SYN with ACK=0* a special boundary case: CE on such a SYN must not be counted in r.cep, and any payload bytes on such a SYN must not be included in any byte counters.
      - This exception is not a minor detail; it underpins:
        - The special handshake encoding in the ACE field (Tables 2–4), where the CE status of SYN/SYN‑ACK is signaled separately from the counters.
        - Preservation and distinctiveness of the non‑zero initial counter values (r.cep/s.cep = 5, r.ceb=0, r.e0b=r.e1b=1), which are used for stateless handshakes and for detecting zeroing/mangling by middleboxes (e.g., Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2.4, 3.2.3.2.4).
        - The constraint that the server must not pre‑consume more than specific initial ACE values during the handshake (Section 3.2.2.2).
      - Thus, the informative overview’s statement “counts the number of packets arriving marked with a CE codepoint (including control packets…)” is strictly broader than the normative rule and fails to mention that:
        - CE on the initial SYN is *never* counted in r.cep.
        - Payload bytes on the initial SYN (SYN=1, ACK=0) are *never* included in any byte counter.
      - In the normal steady‑state data phase, the overview and normative text agree (all CE‑marked non‑SYN packets are counted, and all payload bytes except SYN payload are counted), so the discrepancy only appears at the handshake boundary (SYN/SYN‑ACK), which is exactly where the counters’ special initialization and semantics are critical.
      - Because Section 2 is explicitly “informative” and Section 3 is the normative specification, a fully compliant implementation will follow Section 3 and behave correctly at this edge. Nonetheless, within the document there is a genuine mismatch between the high‑level description and the precise boundary behavior for SYN.
    - ImpactAssessment:
      - For implementers who correctly treat Section 3 as authoritative, there is no interoperability failure: behavior for CE‑marked SYN/SYN‑ACK is well‑specified and consistent.
      - However, the Section 2 text could mislead a reader who relies too heavily on the overview, leading them to (incorrectly) count CE on SYNs and SYN payload bytes in the counters. That would break the invariants assumed by the handshake encoding and middlebox‑detection logic and could cause subtle miscounting around connection startup.
      - Because this inconsistency is confined to an informative section and the normative section is correct and complete, the real‑world risk is limited but non‑zero; it is best categorized as an editorial inconsistency with a boundary‑case (SYN/SYN‑ACK) flavor rather than a protocol‑logic bug in the normative spec.

- Notes:
  - Not a bug: Apart from this SYN/SYN‑ACK exception, the Section 2 overview’s descriptions of counters, ACE wrap behavior, and generic reflection are consistent with the detailed edge‑case rules in Section 3 (e.g., initialization values, rules for ACK‑triggering, ACE wrap safety, and behavior when options are stripped or zeroed). I examined boundary cases for: zero vs non‑zero initial counters, control packets without payload, SYN with and without ECN in presence of middleboxes, and loss/ACK‑thinning; all are normatively covered in Section 3 without contradictions.
