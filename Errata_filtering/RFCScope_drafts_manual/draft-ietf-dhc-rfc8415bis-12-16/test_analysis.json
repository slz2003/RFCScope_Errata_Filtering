      "analysis": "ActorDirectionalityReport:\n- ExcerptSummary: This draft defines DHCPv6 roles (client, server, relay) and, in Section 16, gives per–message-type validity and discard rules, plus global rules on how endpoints treat unknown options/types and what traffic (unicast vs multicast) each role should accept. It also removes the legacy Server Unicast option and UseMulticast status code, and partially replaces their behavior with new text in Section 16. The rest of the excerpt provides the overall client/server/relay message model and option semantics.\n\n- OverallAssessment: PlausibleBug\n\n- FindingsOnRoutedIssues:\n  - (No specific routed CandidateIssues were provided in the prompt, so none can be assessed individually.)\n\n- AdditionalActorIssues:\n  - NewIssue-1:\n    - BugType: Inconsistency\n    - Summary: Section 16 gives servers two conflicting directions about how to handle direct unicast messages from clients after Server Unicast has been obsoleted. One sentence says servers “SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients”, but the following explanatory text explicitly allows upgraded servers to keep receiving such unicast messages from previously signaled clients and characterizes this as harmless. It is unclear whether a bis‑conformant server is expected to drop those requests or process them for backward compatibility.\n    - Evidence:\n      - “Servers SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients.  The Server Unicast option (see Section 21.12) and UseMulticast status code (see Section 21.13) have been obsoleted and hence clients should no longer send messages to a server's unicast address nor receive the UseMulticast status code.”\n      - “However, a server that previously supported the Server Unicast option and is upgraded to not support it, MAY continue to receive unicast messages if it previously sent the client the Server Unicast option.  But this causes no harm and the client will eventually switch back to sending multicast messages…”\n      - Reasoning: The first sentence assigns a clear role constraint: a server, acting as DHCP endpoint, should *not* accept (i.e., should discard/ignore) direct unicast traffic from clients. The immediately following text, however, explicitly contemplates the upgraded server continuing to “receive unicast messages” from those clients and says this “causes no harm”, strongly suggesting that processing them as normal is acceptable for some period. There is no normative instruction that such legacy unicast messages *must* be rejected, and no replacement for the older 18.4 “UseMulticast” behavior. That leaves the server’s responsibility ambiguous: is it obligated to drop those unicast client messages, or is it permitted to keep honoring them? Because this directly affects the direction and validity of client→server unicast traffic, it is an actor/direction inconsistency.\n\n  - NewIssue-2:\n    - BugType: Underspecification\n    - Summary: The blanket statement “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” is not scoped to particular message types or to messages “defined in this document”, yet the rest of the spec already ensures that all legitimate server→client DHCPv6 exchanges in this document are unicast to the client. The later note tries to scope the multicast/unicast rules, but it is not explicit enough, which may create confusion for extensions that might legitimately use multicast toward clients.\n    - Evidence:\n      - “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages.”\n      - “Note: The multicast/unicast rules mentioned above apply to the DHCP messages within this document.  Messages defined in other and future documents may have different rules.”\n      - Elsewhere, all server→client interactions are specified as unicast at the DHCP endpoint: e.g., for Advertise/Reply: “If the original message was received directly by the server, the server unicasts the Advertise or Reply message directly to the client…” (Section 18.3.10); for Reconfigure: “A server sends each Reconfigure message to a single DHCP client, using an IPv6 unicast address of sufficient scope…” (Section 18.3.11). Clients are also told to discard Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages (Sections 16.13–16.14), so clients never legitimately act on multicast messages in this base spec.\n      - Reasoning: In this document’s message model, there is no valid case where a client should process a DHCPv6 message it received via IPv6 multicast; all server→client messages are specified as unicast or as Relay-reply to a relay (which then delivers a plain Reply to the client). Thus “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” is operationally redundant *for this spec*, but its phrasing is broad, not tied to specific message types or even clearly constrained to “messages defined here”. The subsequent note attempts to limit scope (“apply to the DHCP messages within this document”), but the normative sentence itself is unconditional. This could be read as forbidding clients from accepting any future extension that legitimately sends multicast to clients unless that extension explicitly overrides this rule, and it is unclear whether such an override is allowed or how it should be signaled. From an actor/direction standpoint, the client’s responsibility with respect to potential multicast server→client messages is therefore under‑specified and somewhat contradictory: the global SHOULD discourages acceptance, while the note suggests other documents may define different rules without defining the precedence relationship.\n\n  - NewIssue-3:\n    - BugType: Both (Inconsistency and Underspecification, minor)\n    - Summary: The generic text at the start of Section 16 says that when a client or server receives a message containing “known options that are invalid for that message,” it MAY either extract useful information or ignore and discard the whole message. However, later per‑message subsections (e.g., the rules for Information-request) impose hard MUST‑discard requirements on particular invalid combinations (like IA options in an Information-request). This leaves it unclear whether an endpoint is still allowed to “extract information” from such a structurally invalid message, or is absolutely required to discard it, and the roles are not clearly reconciled.\n    - Evidence:\n      - General rule: “Clients and servers MAY choose to either (1) extract information from such a message if the information is of use to the recipient or (2) ignore such a message completely and just discard it.”\n      - Specific rule: “Servers MUST discard any received Information-request message that meets any of the following conditions: … the message includes an IA option.” (Section 16.12)\n      - Reasoning: For servers receiving an Information-request containing an IA option, the general rule suggests they *may* still extract some information from an otherwise “invalid” message, whereas 16.12 declares that such a message MUST be discarded. From an actor perspective, the server’s role in handling that invalid client→server message is given two incompatible behaviors (MAY process vs MUST drop), with no clear precedence statement. Similar patterns appear for other message types. This is a comparatively small issue, but it does create ambiguity about what a client or server is actually allowed/required to do with invalid messages, i.e., whether they may ever process any part of them, which affects the effective direction of information flow in error cases.\n\n- IfNoActorIssues:\n  - Comment: (Not applicable; several actor/direction/role ambiguities were identified, primarily around server handling of legacy client unicast traffic and the scope of client behavior for multicast reception.)",

The only scenario where UseMulticast could appear is in interaction with a non-conforming or legacy client/server that still uses unicast logic; those peers are, by definition, outside the intended scope of 8415bis.\n      - While it is true that the bis document no longer prescribes what a new client “MUST” do if it does receive a UseMulticast status code, the only realistic way this happens is if *the client itself* is violating the new rules by sending unicast. In such a case, behaviour is already undefined because the client is non-compliant; the omission therefore does not create an ambiguity for fully conforming implementations.\n      - The obsoletion language in Section 16 and Section 21.13 narrows the scope of UseMulticast to “not used by messages defined in this document.” That is a scope reduction rather than an internal inconsistency, and the remaining text about Server Unicast provides a plausible transitional story for upgraded servers.\n      - Given that the feature set being removed was “not widely implemented” (1.1) and the on-the-wire triggers for UseMulticast are no longer valid under 8415bis, the lack of transitional semantics for that status code does not materially affect the well-defined behaviour of conforming implementations. This reads more as editorially sparse guidance for mixed RFC 8415 / 8415bis deployments than as a protocol-scope bug.\n  - Issue-2:\n    - BugType: None\n    - ShortLabel: Multicast-acceptance rule for clients is broad but aligned with other sections\n    - ScopeProblemType: N/A\n    - Evidence:\n      - Section 16: “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages. … Note: The multicast/unicast rules mentioned above apply to the DHCP messages within this document. Messages defined in other and future documents may have different rules.”\n      - Section 7.1, 14: only defined multicast destination used by clients is All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (ff02::1:2) for client→server/relay transmission.\n      - Section 18.3.10 and 19.2: Advertise/Reply and Relay-reply transmissions towards clients are specified as unicast (or unicast via relay); Reconfigure is also specified as unicast or via relay (18.3.11).\n    - DetailedReasoning:\n      - The “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” sentence is scoped by the subsequent note to “the DHCP messages within this document,” i.e., the 13 message types defined in Section 7.3. It does not attempt to constrain new message types defined in other RFCs (e.g., ADDR-REG-INFORM/ADDR-REG-REPLY from RFC 9686).\n      - For those 13 message types, the rest of the document already constrains the addressing model so that clients never legitimately receive a DHCPv6 message sent to a multicast destination: servers send Advertise/Reply/Relay-reply/Reconfigure via unicast (either directly or through relays), and relays relay towards the client using the unicast peer-address they recorded.\n      - Thus, the multicast-acceptance rule effectively only covers misdirected or malicious traffic (e.g., someone sending a forged Reply or Reconfigure to a multicast group the client has joined), and it does not conflict with any legitimate behaviour described elsewhere in the document.\n      - The use of “SHOULD NOT” rather than “MUST NOT” is somewhat soft, but since there is no specified, valid use case in this document for receiving any of these message types at a multicast destination, a stricter MUST NOT would not change interoperable behaviour; as written, it gives a conservative security recommendation without altering the core protocol model.\n      - Because the accompanying note explicitly allows other/future message types to have different multicast/unicast rules, implementers of, e.g., RFC 9686 are not accidentally constrained by this sentence; their messages are outside the stated scope.\n      - Taken together, the multicast rules in Section 16, the transmission rules in Section 14 and 18.3, and the relay rules in Section 19 describe a consistent addressing model; the additional “SHOULD NOT accept multicast” line is a reinforcement rather than an inconsistent or ill-scoped requirement.\n\n- ResidualUncertainties:\n  - The document could more explicitly say that if a UseMulticast status code is nonetheless received (e.g., from an RFC 8415 peer), it MUST be treated as a generic failure or ignored, but this situation already presupposes at least one non-conforming endpoint and is not strictly required for the scope of 8415bis itself.\n  - The transitional note about upgraded servers continuing to receive unicast from legacy clients is descriptive and assumes clients will “eventually” revert to multicast; that behaviour is defined by the legacy specifications rather than this one, so it does not strictly create a scope conflict inside this document, but operators of mixed deployments may still want explicit migration guidance.",

      "analysis": "1. **Summary**\n\nFollowing the bis‑12 text literally, the core DHCPv6 state machine still executes coherently. The obsoletion of Server Unicast and UseMulticast does not create a fundamental protocol failure, and the “clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” rule is consistent with the rest of the spec. Mixed old/new deployments may see some inelegant behavior but not hard breakage assuming the bis implementation actually follows the new rules.\n\n---\n\n2. **Causal analysis**\n\n### Issue 1 – UseMulticast + Server Unicast interop\n\n**What the bis text now says**\n\n- Section 16:\n  - “Servers SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients.”  \n  - “The Server Unicast option (see Section 21.12) and UseMulticast status code (see Section 21.13) have been obsoleted and hence clients should no longer send messages to a server's unicast address nor receive the UseMulticast status code. However, a server that previously supported the Server Unicast option and is upgraded to not support it, MAY continue to receive unicast messages if it previously sent the client the Server Unicast option. But this causes no harm and the client will eventually switch back to sending multicast messages …”\n- Section 21.12 now describes the Server Unicast option as obsolete and says:\n  - “The client SHOULD NOT request this option in the Option Request option. The server SHOULD NOT send this option, even when requested … When any entity receives the Server Unicast option, the option SHOULD be ignored and the message processing should continue as usual.”\n- Section 21.13 keeps the UseMulticast code point but marks it “Obsoleted; no longer used.”\n\nSeparately, all client‑side text that previously described *sending* unicast has been removed:\n\n- Section 14: “Unless otherwise specified … a client sends DHCP messages to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.”\n- Section 17.1/17.2 in the bis no longer contain the RFC 8415 paragraphs about sending unicast after receiving Server Unicast.\n- Section 18.4 (“Reception of Unicast Messages”), which defined the UseMulticast error path, is gone in the bis. (The quoted 18.4 text is from RFC 8415, not from the bis.)\n\n**What actually happens with a bis‑conformant client**\n\nIf an implementer follows the bis text:\n\n- The client never *chooses* unicast for any of the base message types, because:\n  - The only generic rule (Section 14) says to send to the ff02::1:2 multicast, “unless otherwise specified”.\n  - No remaining text “otherwise specifies” a unicast case.\n- The client does not request or act on Server Unicast:\n  - It SHOULD NOT list OPTION_UNICAST in ORO.\n  - If an old server nevertheless sends OPTION_UNICAST, the client SHOULD ignore it and “continue as usual” (i.e., keep using multicast).\n\nGiven that:\n\n- An **old RFC 8415 server** only sends UseMulticast when it receives a unicast message from a client that it believes should be using multicast (per old 18.4). A 8415bis client never sends such unicast, so under spec‑compliant behavior it will never see UseMulticast at all.\n- An **8415bis server** is told “SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients” but MAY accept it transiently for clients it previously told to use unicast, and it no longer has any mandate to send UseMulticast.\n\nSo in the *intended* causal path:\n\n- New client ↔ new server: no Server Unicast, no unicast, no UseMulticast.\n- New client ↔ old server: client ignores Server Unicast, uses multicast, so old server has no reason ever to send UseMulticast.\n- Old client ↔ new server:\n  - If the new server decides to drop old unicast Renew/Request, the old client will time out and eventually restart discovery using multicast per its own spec, after which the interaction proceeds normally.\n  - If the new server is lenient and accepts unicast (as Section 16 explicitly allows for upgrades), interop is even smoother.\n\nThe only way to get into the old UseMulticast error path with a bis implementation is if the implementer *violates* the bis (e.g., still implements unicast sending or explicitly supports the obsolete option). The bis spec does not attempt to define behavior for that out‑of‑spec mixed mode.\n\n**Does lack of new behavior for UseMulticast cause breakage?**\n\n- For a strictly bis‑conformant client, UseMulticast is unobservable in any valid causal path, so the fact that 18.2.10 no longer has a special “on UseMulticast, re‑send via multicast” rule does not cause any failure.\n- For an old RFC 8415 server that still uses UseMulticast, its UseMulticast messages were only ever a reaction to *client unicast*; with bis clients that no longer happens.\n\nThus, there is no case where a fully‑compliant bis node *must* handle UseMulticast to make the protocol work. The codepoint is kept only for registry completeness, marked obsolete, and not used in any normative path.\n\n**Conclusion for Issue 1**\n\n- There is no causal inconsistency for bis‑conformant nodes.\n- Mixed old/new deployments degrade gracefully; at worst, an old client talking to a strict new server might take longer to recover (timeout instead of immediate UseMulticast error) before falling back to multicast, but that’s not a fundamental protocol break.\n\nSo Issue 1 is a **non‑issue** from the failure‑analysis perspective.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2 – “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages”\n\n**What the spec actually enforces**\n\nSection 16 says:\n\n- “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages.”\n- “Servers SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients.”\n- “Relay agents SHOULD NOT accept unicast messages from clients.”\n- With an explicit note scoping these rules: “The multicast/unicast rules mentioned above apply to the DHCP messages within this document. Messages defined in other and future documents may have different rules.”\n\nElsewhere:\n\n- Section 5 and 14 state that *clients send* requests to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.\n- Section 18.3.10 requires *servers* to send Advertise/Reply unicast to the client’s unicast address when they receive messages directly; relay agents always forward server replies to the unicast `peer-address` in Relay‑reply.\n- Section 18.3.11: Reconfigure messages are always sent via unicast to a single client (or via relays that then unicast to the client).\n\nSo in the base protocol defined here:\n\n- **All client→server** messages are multicast (to ff02::1:2).\n- **All server→client** messages are unicast (either directly, or via a relay that unicasts them to the client).\n- Clients are not expected to receive legitimate DHCP base‑messages addressed to a multicast destination IP.\n\n**Effect of “SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages”**\n\nOperationally, if an implementer obeys this:\n\n- A client that somehow receives a DHCP base‑message with a multicast destination IP (for example, due to a misconfigured server sending Replies to ff02::1:2) will discard it.\n- This is *aligned* with the rest of the spec, because such a message is already outside the normal server behavior (18.3.10 instructs servers to unicast replies to clients).\n\nIt does **not** conflict with:\n\n- Clients sending to multicast (that’s about outbound; “accept” is about inbound).\n- Relay behaviors (relays accept multicast from clients and send unicast back to clients).\n- Message types defined in other RFCs such as ADDR‑REG‑INFORM / ADDR‑REG‑REPLY in RFC 9686: the note explicitly limits Section 16’s multicast/unicast rules to the message types in this document, allowing other documents to define their own rules.\n\nThere is no state‑machine branch where a client must accept a server message sent to a multicast destination address in order for the protocol to make progress. All valid server→client paths are unicast by construction.\n\n**Conclusion for Issue 2**\n\nThe “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” rule is consistent with the rest of the bis text and simply codifies the intended directionality (client requests via multicast; server replies via unicast). It does not create any unreachable or underspecified state and has clear scope thanks to the accompanying note.\n\nSo Issue 2 is also a **non‑issue** from a causal correctness standpoint.\n\n---\n\n3. **Problem classification**\n\n- **Issue 1 (UseMulticast / Server Unicast interop):** No causal inconsistency or causal underspecification for bis‑conforming nodes. Legacy interop is slightly less optimized (timeouts instead of UseMulticast errors), but still converges.\n- **Issue 2 (clients not accepting multicast messages):** No inconsistency; rule matches the rest of the protocol’s send/receive patterns and is explicitly scoped.\n\n---\n\n4. **Minimal fix shape (not required)**\n\nGiven that there is no real failure mode, no protocol change is strictly needed. If the WG wanted additional clarity, a short non‑normative note could be added to Section 21.13 along the lines of: “If a client nevertheless receives a UseMulticast status code from a legacy server, it MAY treat it as a generic failure and continue retransmission per Section 15,” but this is documentation polish, not necessary for correctness.\n\n---\n\n5. **Non‑issues**\n\n- Keeping UseMulticast in the status‑code registry but marking it “Obsoleted; no longer used” is benign: compliant bis implementations neither generate it nor rely on it.\n- The absence of a specific “on UseMulticast, re‑send via multicast” rule in 18.2.10 is likewise benign because the bis client is no longer permitted to send the corresponding unicast that would trigger those responses.",

The client resends the original message using multicast.”)    That special case has been removed from the 8415bis Section 18.2.10, which now only specifies explicit client behavior for UnspecFail and otherwise says “Otherwise (no status code or another status code), the client processes the Reply as described below…”.  \n      - For strictly 8415bis‑conformant peers, this is consistent: none of them are allowed to *send* UseMulticast and clients “should no longer … receive” it. But the document does not say what a new implementation *MUST* or *SHOULD* do if it nonetheless receives a Reply with top‑level status-code = UseMulticast from a legacy 8415 server or a non‑conformant peer.\n      - Unlike the Server Unicast option, where 21.12 clearly says “When any entity receives the Server Unicast option, the option SHOULD be ignored and the message processing should continue as usual.”   there is no parallel rule for UseMulticast, so an 8415bis client implementer has to guess whether to:\n        * treat it as a generic failure,\n        * ignore it and treat the message as success, or\n        * emulate the old RFC 8415 behavior of resending via multicast.\n      - This leaves the behavior in mixed deployments under‑specified even though the codepoint remains registered and described.\n    - KeyTextSnippets:\n      - “The Server Unicast option (see Section 21.12) and UseMulticast status code (see Section 21.13) have been obsoleted and hence clients should no longer send messages to a server's unicast address nor receive the UseMulticast status code.”  \n      - “UseMulticast (status code 5) … Obsoleted; no longer used.”  \n      - (Old 8415 behavior) “If the client receives a Reply message with a status code of UseMulticast, the client … sends subsequent messages … using multicast. The client resends the original message using multicast.”  \n    - Impact:\n      - Different 8415bis client implementations may make different choices when they unexpectedly receive UseMulticast from legacy servers, leading to non‑interoperable fallback behavior in mixed deployments (some will continue using unicast, some may treat it as fatal error, others may silently ignore).\n      - This is not a problem for strictly new‑to‑new deployments, but it complicates interop with existing RFC 8415 servers and makes debugging behavior around unicast/multicast migration harder. A small, precise rule (“if status-code == UseMulticast, the client SHOULD ignore it and process the Reply as though status = Success” or similar) would close this gap.\n\n  - Issue-2:\n    - BugType: None\n    - Title: “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” – scope is narrow but coherent\n    - Description:\n      - Section 16 states, “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages.” and then immediately notes, “The multicast/unicast rules mentioned above apply to the DHCP messages within this document. Messages defined in other and future documents may have different rules.”  \n      - Elsewhere, the specification consistently describes clients as *sending* to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address, while servers and relays respond via unicast or Relay‑reply; there is no place in this document where a client is required to *receive* a DHCP message sent to a multicast destination.  \n      - For additional DHCPv6 message types defined in other RFCs (e.g., ADDR‑REG‑INFORM / ADDR‑REG‑REPLY in RFC 9686), those documents are explicitly allowed to define different multicast/unicast rules, and the note in Section 16 confines the “SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” to the core message set in this document.\n      - Thus, while the wording is a bit terse, it is not internally contradictory with the rest of 8415bis and gives sufficient room for extensions to override it where necessary.\n    - KeyTextSnippets:\n      - “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages.”  \n      - “Note: The multicast/unicast rules mentioned above apply to the DHCP messages within this document.

The new multicast/unicast guidance (clients and relays not accepting multicast from peers; servers not accepting unicast from clients) is structurally compatible with the rest of the spec because all normative send-side rules still have clients transmit to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address and servers/relays send only unicast back to clients, with Reconfigure also always unicast. The obsoleting of the Server Unicast option and UseMulticast status code is reflected consistently across Section 16, the updated behavior in 17.x/18.x (no remaining normative use of unicast-from-client or UseMulticast), and the option/status-code definitions in Section 21 and Appendix B.

The question is whether these new validation rules are inconsistent with the earlier RFC 8415 behavior or with the IANA dhcpv6-parameters registries, especially for mixed deployments.\n\n- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Low\n\n- Issues:\n  - (none identified)\n\n- IfNoIssues:\n  - Comment: The new Section 16 and related changes appear cross-RFC and registry consistent with RFC 8415 and the IANA DHCPv6 registries, even in the edge cases the router hints at.\n\n    On the Server Unicast / UseMulticast point:\n\n    - RFC 8415 defined:\n      - OPTION_UNICAST (12) and a behavior where a server that received unexpected unicast from a client would send a Reply/Advertise with Status Code UseMulticast (5), instructing the client to revert to multicast  .\n      - Section 18.4 (“Reception of Unicast Messages”) and the special-case client processing in 18.2.10 for UseMulticast implemented that behavior  .\n\n    - The bis draft explicitly and consistently obsoletes both mechanisms:\n      - Section 1.1 states that “allowing clients to unicast some messages directly to the server” is one of the features being obsoleted.\n      - Section 16 says “The Server Unicast option (see Section 21.12) and UseMulticast status code (see Section 21.13) have been obsoleted and hence clients should no longer send messages to a server's unicast address nor receive the UseMulticast status code.” It further notes an *optional* transitional behavior where an upgraded server MAY still accept unicast from clients it previously signaled via Server Unicast.\n      - Section 21.12 (Server Unicast option) now says the client SHOULD NOT request it, the server SHOULD NOT send it, and any recipient SHOULD ignore it and continue processing; the option is retained only for historical reasons.\n      - Section 21.13’s table keeps the UseMulticast code point (5) but clearly labels it “Obsoleted; no longer used.”\n      - Section 25 (IANA Considerations) formally requests IANA to mark OPTION_UNICAST (12) and status code UseMulticast (5) as “Obsolete” in the dhcpv6-parameters registries.\n\n    - The draft also removes the special-case client handling for UseMulticast that existed in RFC 8415’s Section 18.2.10 (the “If the client receives a Reply message with a status code of UseMulticast…” paragraph is gone)  . That is *deliberate* protocol evolution: the new spec is saying “this code still exists in the registry but is no longer used or given semantics in the updated base protocol.”\n\n    From a cross-RFC/registry perspective, that is coherent:\n    - The registries are updated in lockstep with the text (codes are retained but marked Obsolete).\n    - New implementations following rfc8415bis:\n      - Will not send or rely on OPTION_UNICAST or UseMulticast.\n      - Will treat incoming OPTION_UNICAST as a known-but-obsoleted option that MUST just be ignored (as 21.12 states).\n      - Will treat incoming UseMulticast like any other status code with no special meaning; in practice, a bis client already uses multicast, so ignoring UseMulticast does not create an interop failure.\n\n    For *mixed* deployments:\n    - Old RFC 8415 clients can still talk to new servers: they will multicast by default, and if they previously stored a Server Unicast address, the bis server text explicitly allows continuing to receive that unicast traffic for a transitional period. Nothing in the new text contradicts RFC 8415’s behavior on the client side; it simply no longer *requires* or recommends that servers use UseMulticast for recovery.\n    - Old RFC 8415 servers can still talk to new clients: they may send OPTION_UNICAST or UseMulticast, but the bis client will ignore these features and continue to use multicast, which is always legal and required to be supported by any conformant server. There is no registry or code-point mismatch here; the differing semantics are a consequence of obsoleting the feature and are explicitly signaled to IANA.\n\n    Because RFC 8415 is being *obsoleted* rather than normatively referenced, it is not a bug for the bis document to change the semantics of these codepoints; it is a conscious protocol change that is consistently reflected in both the text and the IANA registries.\n\n    On the “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages” line:\n\n    - Section 16 says: “Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages.” This is about the IP *destination* of messages a client receives, not about whether a client itself is allowed to *send* multicast (which it MUST do using ff02::1:2, as described earlier in Sections 5 and 7.1).\n    - In the base DHCPv6 model (both in RFC 8415 and in the bis draft), clients receive Replies and Reconfigures as unicast, either directly from the server or via relay agents; there is no base-protocol case in which a client is expected to process DHCPv6 traffic sent to a multicast destination address.\n    - External specs like RFC 9686 define additional message types (ADDR-REG-INFORM, ADDR-REG-REPLY), but those also follow the same pattern: client-originated messages to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast, replies back unicast. The bis draft even notes in Section 16 that “the multicast/unicast rules mentioned above apply to the DHCP messages within this document. Messages defined in other and future documents may have different rules,” explicitly carving out space for extensions with different reception rules.\n    - So that sentence is not in conflict with RFC 8415 or with the message-type assignments in the IANA registry; it just restates that base DHCPv6 clients are not supposed to process DHCP messages addressed to a multicast destination, and any extension that *does* need that behavior will override it.\n\n    In summary, the draft’s Section 16, together with Sections 21.12, 21.13, and 25, forms a self-consistent update of RFC 8415’s unicast/UseMulticast mechanisms and of the related IANA registry entries. The apparent differences from RFC 8415 are intentional consequences of obsoleting those features, not accidental cross-RFC or registry mismatches.",

The IA/Information-request case is explicitly used as the example of the general rule, so it is not merely an unrelated subset.\n      - In practice, implementers will likely follow the stricter per-message rule (16.12), and treat the global MAY as applying only where no specific MUST-discard rule exists. However, this precedence is not stated, and the IA-in-Information‑request example in the general text actively points in the opposite direction.\n      - This can create divergent interpretations: some implementers may code to the per-message MUST and always drop Information-requests with IA; others may believe they are permitted to “MAY extract information” even for that case, based on the opening paragraph.\n    - ImpactAssessment:\n      - The conflict affects behavior only when the sender is already non-compliant (putting IA options into an Information-request), so it does not affect correct peers but can affect robustness and diagnostic behavior with buggy or experimental clients.\n      - Still, it is a *real* normative inconsistency in how the draft tells servers to handle that invalid-but-plausible boundary case.

The Server Unicast option (see Section 21.12) and UseMulticast status code (see Section 21.13) have been obsoleted… However, a server that previously supported the Server Unicast option and is upgraded to not support it, MAY continue to receive unicast messages if it previously sent the client the Server Unicast option. But this causes no harm and the client will eventually switch back to sending multicast messages…  \n        > Relay agents SHOULD NOT accept unicast messages from clients.” (16)\n\n      - New Server Unicast option text:\n\n        > “The Server Unicast option is obsolete… When the server receives IA_TA option, the option SHOULD be ignored and the message processing should continue as usual.” (21.12, analogous language)\n\n      - UseMulticast status code:\n\n        > “UseMulticast… Obsoleted; no longer used.” (21.13, Table 3)\n\n    - Reasoning:\n      - The draft moves to a model where conformant clients always send to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address, and removes the whole “server-unicast + UseMulticast” feedback loop of RFC 8415.\n      - For *legacy* behavior:\n        - Old clients may still (a) request the Server Unicast option, (b) get it from old servers, and (c) continue sending unicast. New servers are told both “SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients” and that if they previously advertised unicast, they “MAY continue to receive unicast messages” from such clients and that this “causes no harm”.\n        - Old servers may still send Server Unicast or UseMulticast. New clients are told to ignore the obsolete option (21.12) and there is no longer any special handling of UseMulticast in Reply processing, so they simply keep using multicast (which is already required).\n      - At the boundary conditions (T1/T2, address lifetimes):\n        - Even if a new server *does* stop accepting unicast from a legacy client that still tries to use unicast Renew, the client will fall back to Rebind at T2 using multicast, as specified in the base protocol, and so avoid lease expiration in normal deployments. Permanent assignments (T1/T2 = 0xffffffff) are explicitly “use carefully” and are already special cases; the spec does not promise reconfiguration in that extreme.\n      - Thus the obsoleting of Server Unicast and UseMulticast does not create a real behavioral contradiction with the rest of the document: the new multicast-only rules and the residual transition text are consistent enough at the edge cases.\n    - ImpactAssessment:\n      - Interoperability with legacy nodes is preserved in a “best-effort” way; behavior if they still use unicast is at worst some unnecessary retransmissions until T2, not silent protocol failure.\n      - The “causes no harm” phrasing is optimistic but not technically wrong once you examine the T1/T2/Rebind boundary behavior. I therefore do not count this as a specification bug, just as an area where the safety argument relies on the existing timer machinery.\n\n- Notes:\n  - Not a bug but worth noting: Section 16.10 (Reply) gives explicit MUST-discard rules for missing Server Identifier and transaction-id mismatch, but does not say that a client MUST discard a Reply whose Client Identifier option (if present) does not match its own DUID. Instead, it puts the requirement on what the server “MUST” send. For Advertise, a symmetric client-side discard rule *is* present. This asymmetry can lead to differing robustness choices by implementers, but since a conformant server will always echo the correct client DUID and the client already keys the transaction on transaction-id, it is unlikely to cause real interoperability problems.\n  - Not a bug: The rule “Clients, relay agents, and servers MUST NOT discard messages that contain unknown options … These options should be ignored as if they were not present” is intentionally strong to support forward compatibility. It does not preclude discarding messages that are malformed (e.g., bad option length) or that violate message-type-specific MUSTs; it only forbids *using the mere presence of an unknown but syntactically valid option* as a discard trigger.",
