      "explanation": "The draft inconsistently references the Reno congestion control algorithm by citing RFC6582—which actually defines NewReno—in one part and RFC5681 in another, potentially misleading readers about the intended baseline behavior.",
      "justification": [
        "The CrossRFC expert analysis notes that the introductory paragraph cites 'Reno [RFC6582]' while a later sentence correctly associates standard Reno with RFC5681, creating a cross-RFC inconsistency (E1, E2).",
        "The Terminology expert analysis reinforces that this mislabelling may confuse implementers or readers regarding the actual reference for Reno, suggesting the citation should be standardized (E1, E2)."

        "summary": [
          "(E1) shows the initial use of RFC6582 for Reno; (E2) shows the later correct use of RFC5681 for standard Reno."
