You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CrossRFCReport:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 1 of the AccECN draft introduces Accurate ECN feedback, compares it to Classic ECN as defined in RFC 3168, and positions it relative to existing congestion controls (Reno, CUBIC, DCTCP, L4S, ABE, ConEx). It makes cross-references to several congestion-control RFCs and to the ECN framework (RFC 3168, RFC 8311).
- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Medium
- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Inconsistent and partially incorrect RFC references for “Reno”
    - Description: In the introductory paragraph, the draft states “congestion control scheme like Reno [RFC6582] and Cubic [RFC9438]”, implying that RFC 6582 is the defining reference for “Reno.” However, RFC 6582 is “The NewReno Modification to TCP’s Fast Recovery Algorithm” and explicitly describes itself as a modification to the fast recovery procedure of TCP congestion control as specified in RFC 5681, not as the base Reno algorithm  . The base TCP congestion control commonly associated with “Reno” is specified in RFC 5681 (“TCP Congestion Control”)  . Later in Section 1, the same draft refers to “standard Reno or CUBIC congestion control [RFC5681] [RFC9438]”, here correctly tying Reno to RFC 5681. This creates a cross-RFC inconsistency: the name “Reno” is associated with two different RFCs in the same section, and one of them (RFC 6582) actually defines “NewReno.” While the technical impact is small (both Reno and NewReno reduce cwnd by a fixed factor once per RTT, which is the property AccECN cares about), an implementer or reader trying to trace “Reno” behavior could be misled to treat RFC 6582 as the primary Reno spec, or to infer that AccECN assumes NewReno-specific behavior where only generic Reno behavior is intended. A consistent treatment would either: (a) cite RFC 5681 for “Reno” everywhere and optionally mention NewReno explicitly when RFC 6582 is cited, or (b) rename the first occurrence to “NewReno [RFC6582]” if that was the actual intent. As written, the cross-reference mapping between the algorithm name and the defining RFCs is inconsistent.
    - EntitiesInvolved: ["Reno congestion control", "RFC 5681 (TCP Congestion Control)", "RFC 6582 (NewReno Modification)", "RFC 9438 (CUBIC)", "AccECN draft Section 1"]
    - CrossRefsUsed: ["RFC 5681 Section 3 (Reno congestion control behavior)", "RFC 6582 Sections 1 and 3 (defines NewReno as a modification to RFC 5681)", "AccECN draft text referencing Reno with RFC6582 and later with RFC5681"]
    - Confidence: High

## Terminology Expert

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TerminologyAnalysis:
- OverallBugLikelihood: Low
- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - Severity: Low
    - ShortLabel: Mislabelled “Reno” reference (RFC6582 vs RFC5681)
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - “This is sufficient for congestion control scheme like Reno [RFC6582] and Cubic [RFC9438]…” (Section 1, first paragraph)
        - “Like Classic ECN feedback, AccECN can be used by standard Reno or CUBIC congestion control [RFC5681] [RFC9438]…” (later in Section 1)
      - ContextSnippets:
        - RFC 6582 is titled “The NewReno Modification to TCP’s Fast Recovery Algorithm” and describes the NewReno fast recovery behavior, not the base Reno congestion control algorithm  .
        - RFC 5681 is titled “TCP Congestion Control” and is the main standards-track specification for the Reno-style congestion control behavior  .
    - Reasoning:
      - In the introductory text, the term “Reno” is explicitly associated with RFC 6582: “Reno [RFC6582]”. However, RFC 6582 specifies only the NewReno modification to fast recovery, not the full Reno congestion control algorithm.
      - Later in the same section, “standard Reno … congestion control” is cited to RFC 5681, which *is* the correct reference for the overall Reno congestion control behavior.
      - Thus, the same conceptual label (“Reno”) is tied to two different RFC references: once to 6582 and once to 5681. This is a naming/reference inconsistency: the first reference points at a refinement (NewReno fast recovery), while the later one points at the base congestion control document.
      - The text’s argument does not depend on the subtle distinction between Reno and NewReno; it only needs an example of a standard TCP congestion control that reacts at most once per RTT, independent of the number of ECN marks. Both Reno and NewReno satisfy that property. So the technical behavior is not mis-specified, but an implementer or reader who follows the first citation could reasonably be confused about which “Reno” baseline the draft assumes.
      - Given that later references already use RFC 5681 for “standard Reno”, the inconsistent and slightly misleading use of RFC 6582 for “Reno” in the opening paragraph is best treated as a minor terminology / reference bug suitable for an erratum.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - In Section 1, first paragraph, replace:
        - “Reno [RFC6582] and Cubic [RFC9438]”
      - With one of the following, to align terminology and references:
        - Preferred minimal fix:
          - “Reno [RFC5681] and CUBIC [RFC9438]”
        - Or, if the intent was to refer specifically to NewReno:
          - “NewReno [RFC6582] and CUBIC [RFC9438]”
      - And for consistency, consider standardizing the capitalization of “Cubic” as “CUBIC” to match RFC 9438, as is already done later in the text (purely editorial).

- Notes:
  - UsedRouterIssues: Confirmed the router’s Candidate Issue about RFC6582 vs RFC5681; no additional substantive terminology bugs were found beyond that.
  - NewIssuesFromExpert: false
  - Limitations:
    - Analysis is based on the provided excerpt and referenced RFC fragments. No additional inconsistencies in field names, option names, or registry identifiers were evident from this material; any further issues would require a broader sweep of the full draft and all references.
