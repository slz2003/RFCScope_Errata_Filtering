RFC 6582, however, is “The NewReno Modification to TCP’s Fast Recovery Algorithm” and not the base Reno congestion control spec; RFC 5681 is the main TCP congestion control specification commonly associated with “Reno”. Later in Section 1, the text talks about “standard Reno or CUBIC congestion control [RFC5681] [RFC9438]”. Experts should check whether the first reference should be to RFC5681 instead of (or in addition to) RFC6582, and whether the mixed use of 6582 and 5681 for “Reno” could confuse readers about which behavior is being assumed as “Reno” baseline (classic Reno vs NewReno). If the intent was to refer specifically to NewReno or to generic TCP congestion control, the citation and wording might need alignment, but this is likely an editorial/cross-reference issue rather than a protocol bug."

      "analysis": "CrossRFCReport:\n- ExcerptSummary: Section 1 of the AccECN draft introduces Accurate ECN feedback, compares it to Classic ECN as defined in RFC 3168, and positions it relative to existing congestion controls (Reno, CUBIC, DCTCP, L4S, ABE, ConEx). It makes cross-references to several congestion-control RFCs and to the ECN framework (RFC 3168, RFC 8311).\n- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Medium\n- Issues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: Inconsistency\n    - ShortLabel: Inconsistent and partially incorrect RFC references for “Reno”\n    - Description: In the introductory paragraph, the draft states “congestion control scheme like Reno [RFC6582] and Cubic [RFC9438]”, implying that RFC 6582 is the defining reference for “Reno.” However, RFC 6582 is “The NewReno Modification to TCP’s Fast Recovery Algorithm” and explicitly describes itself as a modification to the fast recovery procedure of TCP congestion control as specified in RFC 5681, not as the base Reno algorithm  . The base TCP congestion control commonly associated with “Reno” is specified in RFC 5681 (“TCP Congestion Control”)  . Later in Section 1, the same draft refers to “standard Reno or CUBIC congestion control [RFC5681] [RFC9438]”, here correctly tying Reno to RFC 5681. This creates a cross-RFC inconsistency: the name “Reno” is associated with two different RFCs in the same section, and one of them (RFC 6582) actually defines “NewReno.” While the technical impact is small (both Reno and NewReno reduce cwnd by a fixed factor once per RTT, which is the property AccECN cares about), an implementer or reader trying to trace “Reno” behavior could be misled to treat RFC 6582 as the primary Reno spec, or to infer that AccECN assumes NewReno-specific behavior where only generic Reno behavior is intended. A consistent treatment would either: (a) cite RFC 5681 for “Reno” everywhere and optionally mention NewReno explicitly when RFC 6582 is cited, or (b) rename the first occurrence to “NewReno [RFC6582]” if that was the actual intent. As written, the cross-reference mapping between the algorithm name and the defining RFCs is inconsistent.\n    - EntitiesInvolved: [\"Reno congestion control\", \"RFC 5681 (TCP Congestion Control)\", \"RFC 6582 (NewReno Modification)\", \"RFC 9438 (CUBIC)\", \"AccECN draft Section 1\"]\n    - CrossRefsUsed: [\"RFC 5681 Section 3 (Reno congestion control behavior)\", \"RFC 6582 Sections 1 and 3 (defines NewReno as a modification to RFC 5681)\", \"AccECN draft text referencing Reno with RFC6582 and later with RFC5681\"]\n    - Confidence: High",

However, RFC 6582 specifies only the NewReno modification to fast recovery, not the full Reno congestion control algorithm.\n      - Later in the same section, “standard Reno … congestion control” is cited to RFC 5681, which *is* the correct reference for the overall Reno congestion control behavior.\n      - Thus, the same conceptual label (“Reno”) is tied to two different RFC references: once to 6582 and once to 5681. This is a naming/reference inconsistency: the first reference points at a refinement (NewReno fast recovery), while the later one points at the base congestion control document.\n      - The text’s argument does not depend on the subtle distinction between Reno and NewReno; it only needs an example of a standard TCP congestion control that reacts at most once per RTT, independent of the number of ECN marks. Both Reno and NewReno satisfy that property. So the technical behavior is not mis-specified, but an implementer or reader who follows the first citation could reasonably be confused about which “Reno” baseline the draft assumes.\n      - Given that later references already use RFC 5681 for “standard Reno”, the inconsistent and slightly misleading use of RFC 6582 for “Reno” in the opening paragraph is best treated as a minor terminology / reference bug suitable for an erratum.\n    - PatchSuggestion:\n      - In Section 1, first paragraph, replace:\n        - “Reno [RFC6582] and Cubic [RFC9438]”\n      - With one of the following, to align terminology and references:\n        - Preferred minimal fix:\n          - “Reno [RFC5681] and CUBIC [RFC9438]”\n        - Or, if the intent was to refer specifically to NewReno:\n          - “NewReno [RFC6582] and CUBIC [RFC9438]”\n      - And for consistency, consider standardizing the capitalization of “Cubic” as “CUBIC” to match RFC 9438, as is already done later in the text (purely editorial).\n\n- Notes:\n  - UsedRouterIssues: Confirmed the router’s Candidate Issue about RFC6582 vs RFC5681; no additional substantive terminology bugs were found beyond that.\n  - NewIssuesFromExpert: false\n  - Limitations:\n    - Analysis is based on the provided excerpt and referenced RFC fragments.
