You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 9 defines the on‑the‑wire format and basic semantics of the DHCPv6 relay messages (Relay-forward and Relay-reply), including hop-count, link-address, peer-address, and the mandatory Relay Message option, and how these are used to encapsulate client/server messages across relays.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing/timing behavior is defined here; it’s pure format/field semantics.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Roles (relay vs server vs client) are consistent with the general model and with section 19; no inversions evident in this excerpt.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope of fields (per relay hop vs end‑to‑end) is clearly relay‑local and matches the rest of the spec; no obvious scope confusion.
  - Causal: LOW - The field definitions (hop-count, link-address, peer-address, options) are usable as‑is and fit with the relay behavior in section 19; no behavior-breaking instructions visible here.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Length calculations (options area is “34 octets less than the size of the message”) match the header size (1+1+16+16); no range/size conflict apparent.
  - Deontic: LOW - The few MUST/MAY statements (e.g., Relay Message option MUST be present) are consistent with section 21.10 and section 19; no internal requirement conflicts.
  - Structural: LOW - The relay header diagram and field descriptions align with the rest of the document (e.g., 7.3 message types, 21.10 Relay Message option); no ABNF/diagram vs prose mismatches.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Cross-references (to RFC7227, 19.1.1, 21.10, 21.18, and 13.1 as updated in this draft) are coherent; no obvious mismatch with those external texts as quoted.
  - Terminology: LOW - Names and uses of msg-type, hop-count, link-address, peer-address, and “Relay-forward/Relay-reply” are consistent with section 7.3 and older RFC8415 usage.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge cases (e.g., link-address set to 0 in nested relays) are handled in sections 13.1 and 19.1.2; section 9’s generic definitions don’t contradict that handling.
