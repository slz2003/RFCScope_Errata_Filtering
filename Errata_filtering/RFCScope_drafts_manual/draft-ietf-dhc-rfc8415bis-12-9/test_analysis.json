    "excerpt_summary": "Section 9 defines the on‑the‑wire format and basic semantics of the DHCPv6 relay messages (Relay-forward and Relay-reply), including hop-count, link-address, peer-address, and the mandatory Relay Message option, and how these are used to encapsulate client/server messages across relays.",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No sequencing/timing behavior is defined here; it’s pure format/field semantics."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Roles (relay vs server vs client) are consistent with the general model and with section 19; no inversions evident in this excerpt."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The scope of fields (per relay hop vs end‑to‑end) is clearly relay‑local and matches the rest of the spec; no obvious scope confusion."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The field definitions (hop-count, link-address, peer-address, options) are usable as‑is and fit with the relay behavior in section 19; no behavior-breaking instructions visible here."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Length calculations (options area is “34 octets less than the size of the message”) match the header size (1+1+16+16); no range/size conflict apparent."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The few MUST/MAY statements (e.g., Relay Message option MUST be present) are consistent with section 21.10 and section 19; no internal requirement conflicts."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The relay header diagram and field descriptions align with the rest of the document (e.g., 7.3 message types, 21.10 Relay Message option); no ABNF/diagram vs prose mismatches."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Cross-references (to RFC7227, 19.1.1, 21.10, 21.18, and 13.1 as updated in this draft) are coherent; no obvious mismatch with those external texts as quoted."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Names and uses of msg-type, hop-count, link-address, peer-address, and “Relay-forward/Relay-reply” are consistent with section 7.3 and older RFC8415 usage."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Edge cases (e.g., link-address set to 0 in nested relays) are handled in sections 13.1 and 19.1.2; section 9’s generic definitions don’t contradict that handling."
