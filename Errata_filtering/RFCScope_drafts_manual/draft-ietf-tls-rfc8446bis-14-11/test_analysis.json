All codepoint ranges, allocation policies (Specification Required vs Private Use), “Recommended”/“DTLS‑OK” column rules, and registry names align with the referenced RFCs. Any oddities (e.g., slightly awkward wording in the introductory paragraph, duplication in mentioning general_error, or repeating older name‑normalization steps) are editorial and do not affect protocol behavior or registry correctness."
