You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 11 defines the IANA-related actions for TLS 1.3 (cipher suites, content types, alerts, handshake types, extensions, certificate types/status, supported groups, and the new SignatureScheme and PskKeyExchangeMode registries), plus meta‑instructions to update RFC 8446 references and rename the extended_main_secret extension.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Purely registry/administrative text; no sequencing, timers, or state transitions.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Only refers to IANA’s role in maintaining registries, no protocol message flow.
  - Scope: LOW - Scope of rules (per registry) is clear and matches the registries’ intended use.
  - Causal: LOW - No operational algorithm here; registry policies do not drive protocol behavior directly.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Byte ranges for codepoints and registry ranges are consistent with referenced RFCs; no size/range math to reconcile.
  - Deontic: LOW - Normative language (“MUST”, “assigned via Specification Required”, etc.) is consistent with BCP 26 and prior TLS IANA texts; no conflicting requirements detected.
  - Structural: LOW - Registry names and fields (e.g., TLS Cipher Suites, TLS ExtensionType Values, TLS SignatureScheme) match existing IANA structures; field mappings to appendices (B.2, B.3, B.4) are coherent.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Policies (Specification Required, Private Use), column semantics (“Recommended”, “DTLS‑OK”), and specific updates (e.g., ocsp_multi_RESERVED, OpenPGP_RESERVED, x25519/x448 references) align with RFC 4346, 4366, 6091, 6961, 7919, 8126, 8422, 8446, and 8447 as excerpted.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terminology for registries and entries (e.g., “extended_main_secret”, “general_error”, “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode”) is consistent and unambiguous.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge‑case behaviors are defined here; this is about registry ranges and policies already covered by BCP 26 patterns.
