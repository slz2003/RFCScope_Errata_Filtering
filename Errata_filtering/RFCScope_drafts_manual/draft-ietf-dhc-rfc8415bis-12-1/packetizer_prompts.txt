You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 1 introduces DHCPv6, mentions prefix delegation and stateless mode, describes how this document obsoletes RFC 8415 and some features, and lists topics explicitly out of scope (e.g., DHCPv4/DHCPv6 merging).
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No state machines or ordering rules are specified here beyond high-level descriptions.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Client/server and requesting/delegating roles are only mentioned at a descriptive level with no operational rules that could be inconsistent.
  - Scope: LOW - The "topics out of scope" subsection is declarative; it does not define behavioral scopes that could conflict internally.
  - Causal: LOW - No algorithms or cause–effect chains are laid out that would produce concrete misbehavior if misinterpreted.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No critical numeric ranges, timers, or sizes are defined in this section.
  - Deontic: LOW - Normative language is only the BCP 14 boilerplate; there are no detailed MUST/SHOULD requirements here that could conflict.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF, YANG, diagrams, or detailed formats are present in Section 1 that need structural consistency checking.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References (RFC7084, TR‑187, RFC2131, RFC4477, RFC7341, RFC8415, RFC9243) are high-level and descriptive; no section numbers or protocol details are imported in a way that is likely to be incorrect.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terminology such as “requesting router” vs “client” and “delegating router” vs “server” is explicitly mapped and consistent at this overview level.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge conditions or exceptional cases are not discussed in this introductory material.
