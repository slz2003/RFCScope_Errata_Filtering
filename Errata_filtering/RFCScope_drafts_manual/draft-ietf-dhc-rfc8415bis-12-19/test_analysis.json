However, when the server initiates Reconfigure exchanges in\n    topologies with multiple relays, the specification becomes vague\n    about how (or whether) the multi-relay path is reconstructed, leaving\n    observable temporal behavior for Reconfigure under-specified.\n  OverallTemporalRisk: Low\n  CandidateIssues:\n    - Id: T1\n      Type: Underspecification\n      ShortLabel: Reconfigure over multi-relay chains\n      Description: |\n        The document precisely specifies how replies to client‑initiated\n        exchanges must traverse the same chain of relay agents in reverse\n        order, by nesting Relay-reply messages matching the nested\n        Relay-forward path, and by requiring the server to record the\n        peer-address fields seen on the way in. In contrast, for\n        server‑initiated Reconfigure, the text only clearly describes the\n        case of sending via a single relay and then explicitly treats\n        the use of relays for Reconfigure as an implementation detail.\n        There is no normative guidance on how to reconstruct a multi-hop\n        Relay-reply chain for Reconfigure, or even whether a server is\n        expected to do so, in a topology with two or more relays between\n        client and server. As a result, different implementations may\n        exhibit different temporal behavior: some may successfully\n        deliver Reconfigure messages across multiple relays, while\n        others may only support direct or single-relay delivery, even\n        though the client side state machine expects Reconfigure to\n        arrive at any time. This affects the observable ordering of\n        “Reconfigure → Renew/Rebind/Information-request → Reply” in\n        multi-relay deployments.\n      TemporalReasoning: |\n        For client‑initiated exchanges, the timeline is clearly defined.\n        A client sends a message (e.g., Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind)\n        that may be relayed through a chain of relay agents, each adding\n        a new Relay-forward layer with incremented hop-count and\n        appropriate link-address / peer-address, until the server\n        receives an outermost Relay-forward. The server is required to\n        record the sequence of peer-address values and then, when it\n        replies, construct a nested Relay-reply chain so that the\n        response “MUST be relayed through the same relay agents as the\n        original client message” . That guarantees\n        a deterministic reverse path: each relay peels one layer of\n        encapsulation per 19.2 , forwarding the\n        inner message towards the next downstream hop.\n        \n        For server‑initiated Reconfigure, 18.3.11 states that the server\n        sends each Reconfigure “to a single DHCP client, using an IPv6\n        unicast address of sufficient scope belonging to the DHCP\n        client,” and, if it cannot send directly, “uses a Relay-reply\n        message (as described in Section 19.3) to send the Reconfigure\n        message to a relay agent that will relay the message to the\n        client” . Section 19.3 then describes the\n        Reconfigure case as: “the server creates a Relay-reply message\n        that includes a Relay Message option containing the Reconfigure\n        message for the next relay agent in the return path to the\n        client. The server sets the peer-address field … to the address\n        of the client and sets the link-address field as required by the\n        relay agent to relay the Reconfigure message to the client” .\n        This describes only a single Relay-reply header around the\n        Reconfigure message, implicitly assuming a single downstream\n        relay that can directly reach the client.\n        \n        In a multi‑relay topology (e.g., client C → relay A → relay B →\n        server), the normal reply path is: the server constructs an\n        outer Relay-reply for B (peer-address=A, hop-count=1) whose\n        Relay Message carries an inner Relay-reply for A (peer-address=C,\n        hop-count=0) containing the Reply to the client, as in Figure 10\n        . For Reconfigure however, the text never\n        normatively says whether the server must similarly reconstruct\n        a full nested chain (B→A→C) from stored relay information, or\n        whether it can pick only one “appropriate relay agent”, resulting\n        in either a single Relay-reply to A or B. Section 19.4 further\n        states that using relays for Reconfigure “is considered an\n        implementation detail and is out of scope for this document” ,\n        which effectively leaves the multi‑relay behavior unspecified.\n        \n        On the client side, 18.2.11 assumes that a valid Reconfigure can\n        arrive “at any time” and then triggers a Renew/Rebind or\n        Information-request exchange with the server, with its own\n        retransmission and timeout behavior .\n        Whether that Reconfigure reaches the client at all in a multi‑relay\n        deployment depends on the server’s non-specified choice of how\n        to construct Relay-replys, so the effective ordering “server\n        decides to reconfigure → Reconfigure received at client →\n        client starts Renew/Rebind or Info-Request” is not guaranteed in\n        all topologies.\n      KeyEvidence:\n        ExcerptPoints:\n          - “A response to the client MUST be relayed through the same\n            relay agents as the original client message. The server\n            causes this to happen by creating a Relay-reply message that\n            includes a Relay Message option … The contained Relay-reply\n            message contains another Relay Message option … and so on.\n            The server must record the contents of the peer-address\n            fields …” \n          - “When sending a Reconfigure message to a client through a\n            relay agent, the server creates a Relay-reply message that\n            includes a Relay Message option containing the Reconfigure\n            message for the next relay agent in the return path to the\n            client. The server sets the peer-address field … to the\n            address of the client and sets the link-address field as\n            required by the relay agent to relay the Reconfigure\n            message…” \n          - “A server sends each Reconfigure message to a single DHCP\n            client, using an IPv6 unicast address of sufficient scope\n            belonging to the DHCP client. If the server does not have an\n            address to which it can send the Reconfigure message\n            directly to the client, the server uses a Relay-reply\n            message (as described in Section 19.3) to send the\n            Reconfigure message to a relay agent that will relay the\n            message to the client.” \n          - “The server may choose to not send the Reconfigure message\n            directly to the client but rather to send it via relays.\n            This particular behavior is considered an implementation\n            detail and is out of scope for this document.” \n          - Client-side handling: “Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure\n            message, the client responds with a Renew message, a Rebind\n            message, or an Information-request message … While the\n            transaction is in progress, the client discards any\n            Reconfigure messages it receives.” \n        ContextPoints:\n          - The general multi-relay reply construction and Relay-reply\n            example in Section 19.3 \n      ImpactOnImplementations: |\n        Implementations can differ in how they send Reconfigure across\n        multiple relays: some may reconstruct the full nested\n        Relay-reply chain based on recorded peer-addresses, while others\n        may only support direct or single-relay delivery, treating any\n        additional relays as out of scope. In the latter case, clients\n        behind two or more relays will never receive Reconfigure and\n        thus will not trigger the “Reconfigure → Renew/Rebind/Info-request\n        → Reply” sequence, relying solely on normal T1/T2 or information\n        refresh timers to pick up configuration changes. This does not\n        break basic address assignment or renewal, but it does mean that\n        network operators cannot rely on Reconfigure to propagate\n        immediate changes in all relay topologies.\n      AffectedArtifacts:\n        - Section 18.3.11 (Creation and Transmission of Reconfigure Messages)\n        - Section 19.3 (Construction of Relay-reply Messages)\n        - Section 19.4 (Interaction between Relay Agents and Servers)\n      Severity: Low",

Section 13.1 partly\n        reconciles this by telling servers to ignore link-address==0, but\n        Section 19.1.1 never acknowledges this special case. As a result,\n        the same actor type (“relay agent”) appears to be given mutually\n        incompatible obligations across documents, and the exception for\n        LDRAs is not clearly scoped in this draft.\n    - Evidence:\n      - ExcerptSnippets:\n        - Section 19.1.1: “If the relay agent received the message to be relayed from a client,\n          the relay agent places a globally scoped unicast address (i.e., GUA or ULA) from a\n          prefix assigned to the link… into the link-address field. If such an address is not\n          available, the relay agent may set the link-address field to a link-local address…”\n        - Section 19.1.1: “If the relay agent cannot use the address in the link-address field to\n          identify the interface… the relay agent MUST include an Interface-Id option… The\n          relay agent sets the link-address field as described earlier in this subsection,\n          regardless of whether the relay agent includes an Interface-Id option…”\n        - Section 19 (intro): “[RFC6221] defines a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA) that\n          allows relay agent information to be inserted by an access node that performs a\n          link-layer bridging (i.e., non-routing) function.”\n        - RFC6221 §6.1 (quoted in the prompt): “The LDRA MUST set the link-address field of\n          the Relay-Forward message to the Unspecified Address (::) and MUST include the\n          Interface-ID option in all DHCP Relay-Forward messages.”\n        - Section 13.1: “If the server receives the message from a forwarding relay agent…\n          According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is\n          zero.”\n        - RFC7969 §3.2 (quoted): discussion of using Interface-Id when link-address may be\n          link-local or unspecified; and LDRA case with link-address set to :: plus Interface-Id.\n      - Reasoning: >\n          From an actor/direction perspective, Section 19.1.1 is written as a\n          generic rule for “a relay agent” handling a client-originated\n          message: it normatively directs the relay to populate link-address\n          with a GUA/ULA (or, failing that, a link-local), and it explicitly\n          says to do this “regardless of whether the relay agent includes an\n          Interface-Id option.” This appears to apply to all relay agents,\n          including LDRAs, because they are introduced here simply as another\n          kind of “relay agent”.  \n          However, RFC6221 assigns a conflicting normative requirement to the\n          LDRA actor: it MUST set link-address to :: and MUST include\n          Interface-Id. That is the exact opposite of “places a GUA/ULA or\n          link-local into link-address… regardless of Interface-Id.”\n          Section 13.1 partly harmonizes server behavior (MUST ignore\n          link-address==0 and, by implication, use Interface-Id per 6221/7969),\n          so the server-side algorithm for identifying the client’s link is\n          broadly coherent when you read all three documents together. But on\n          the relay side, an LDRA implementer reading only this bis draft\n          sees a generic “relay agent” rule that contradicts RFC6221’s\n          LDRA-specific rule, with no explicit carve-out such as “except as\n          specified for LDRAs in RFC6221, which set link-address to :: and\n          rely on Interface-Id.”  \n          Thus:\n          - There is an inconsistency in normative obligations for the same\n            actor (LDRA as a specialized relay agent) across RFC6221 and this\n            draft (Inconsistency).\n          - Within this draft, the special LDRA behavior (link-address=::,\n            reliance on Interface-Id) is only indirectly implied via the\n            server-side “ignore link-address=0” text in 13.1 and external\n            references, not clearly specified in 19.1.1 where relay behavior\n            is defined (Underspecification).  \n          Because a careful implementer can still reconcile the behavior by\n          treating 6221 as a more specific rule for LDRAs and this draft as\n          the generic rule for L3 relays, this is more a clarity/consistency\n          problem than a hard interoperability break, hence “PlausibleBug”\n          rather than “StrongEvidenceOfBug”.\n\n- AdditionalActorIssues:\n  - NewIssue-1:\n    - BugType: Underspecification\n    - Summary: >\n        The draft relies implicitly on external documents (RFC6221, RFC7969)\n        for the full server-side algorithm of mapping a chain of Relay-forward\n        messages to the client’s link and interface, especially when some\n        relays use link-address==:: with Interface-Id (LDRA) and others use\n        non-zero link-address. Within this document, Section 13.1 hints at\n        using the “most encapsulated” Relay-forward’s link-address but does\n        not spell out what to do when the closest relay has link-address==0\n        and only an Interface-Id, leaving the reliance on those external\n        mechanisms somewhat implicit.\n    - Evidence:\n      - “The link-address in this case may come from any of the Relay-forward messages\n        encapsulated in the received Relay-forward, and in general the most encapsulated\n        (closest Relay-forward to the client) has the most useful value.” (Section 13.1)\n      - “According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value\n        is zero.” (Section 13.1)\n      - RFC7969 §3.2 (quoted): explains that when link-address is link-local or :: (LDRA\n        case), the server must use additional configured information and/or Interface-Id to\n        determine the client’s link.\n    - Reasoning: >\n        Directionally, the server must map from a stack of Relay-forward\n        headers (each with its own link-address and possibly Interface-Id)\n        back to the “real” client link to decide which pool and topology\n        apply. Section 13.1 gives only high-level guidance (“most\n        encapsulated” link-address, ignore link-address==0), and the relay\n        behavior sections do not explicitly restate how Interface-Id and\n        link-address together determine the effective link in mixed LDRA +\n        traditional relay chains. The intended behavior is clearly spelled\n        out in RFC7969 and RFC6221, but within this bis draft it remains\n        somewhat implicit which fields the server should prioritize (innermost\n        non-zero link-address vs. Interface-Id when zero). This is not a hard\n        contradiction, but it is a mild underspecification of the server’s\n        role in interpreting relay-added fields, and implementers must rely on\n        external RFCs to construct the full, precise algorithm.",

If such an address is not available, the relay agent may set the link-address field to a link-local address…” and “The relay agent sets the link-address field as described earlier in this subsection, regardless of whether the relay agent includes an Interface-Id option in the Relay-forward message.”\n      - RFC 6221 §6.1 (LDRA): “The LDRA MUST set the link-address field of the Relay-Forward message to the Unspecified Address (::) and MUST include the Interface-ID option in all DHCP Relay-Forward messages.”\n      - Section 13.1: “According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero.”\n    - DetailedReasoning:\n      - Section 19.1.1 is written as a generic algorithm for “a relay agent” relaying a message from a client: it states that the relay “places a globally scoped unicast address … into the link-address field” and, failing that, “may” use a link-local, and further says the relay “sets the link-address field as described earlier … regardless of whether” Interface-Id is used.\n      - This description appears to apply to all relay agents, without qualification, and thus formally includes LDRAs, especially since Section 19.1 explicitly introduces RFC 6221 within the same relay-behavior section.\n      - However, RFC 6221 §6.1 mandates a different behavior for LDRAs: `link-address` MUST be the unspecified address `::` and an Interface-ID MUST be present; this is incompatible with “place a GUA/ULA or link-local in link-address” as the generic rule.\n      - Section 13.1 then pulls RFC 6221 semantics into server processing: “the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero.” Combined with RFC 6221, that means for an LDRA, servers either rely on Interface-Id (if only LDRA is involved) or use non-zero `link-address` from outer relays when they exist (as RFC 7969 explains).\n      - In practice, an implementer of an LDRA should follow RFC 6221 and set `link-address = ::` with Interface-ID, but reading 19.1.1 in isolation yields a different behavior for “a relay agent” and does not explicitly say “except for LDRAs defined in RFC 6221, which must use ::”.\n      - Because 19.1.1 uses descriptive language (“places …”) plus one normative MAY (link-local) and a normative MUST for adding Interface-Id only when `link-address` cannot identify the outgoing interface, the formal scope is ambiguous: is the LDRA allowed to violate these “places … GUA/ULA or link-local” rules, or is it supposed to follow them and thus contradict RFC 6221?\n      - Section 13.1 partially reconciles semantics on the server side (ignore zero `link-address`), but it does not explicitly state that LDRAs are expected to use `::` in `link-address`, nor that 19.1.1 does not apply to LDRAs for that field.\n      - If 19.1.1 is implemented literally for all relays, an LDRA implementation following 8415bis alone could incorrectly populate `link-address` with a GUA/ULA or link-local instead of `::`, defeating RFC 6221’s design (Interface-Id-only identification of client link) and making some RFC 6221-based topologies behave incorrectly.\n      - Conversely, if implementers know RFC 6221 well, they will correctly treat it as an exception to 19.1.1, but this relies on external knowledge rather than explicit scoping in the base spec, which is risky given that 8415bis intends to be the unified DHCPv6 reference and already mentions LDRAs in Section 19.1.\n      - A minimal fix would be for Section 19.1.1 to explicitly clarify the scope, for example: “For relay agents other than LDRAs [RFC6221], the relay agent places a globally scoped unicast…; LDRAs MUST instead set link-address to :: and include Interface-Id as specified in [RFC6221].” This would make the interaction between 19.1.1, 13.1, RFC 6221, and RFC 7969 unambiguous and correctly scoped.\n\n  - Issue-2:\n    - BugType: Underspecification\n    - ShortLabel: No specified behavior when Relay-reply has neither Interface-Id nor non-zero `link-address`\n    - ScopeProblemType: Missing error-handling rule for a clearly out-of-scope input (Relay-reply without any usable link identifier); under-specified relay behavior.\n    - Evidence:\n      - Section 19.2: “The relay agent extracts the message from the Relay Message option and relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field of the Relay-reply message. … If the Relay-reply message includes an Interface-Id option … the relay agent relays the message … on the link identified by the Interface-Id option. Otherwise, if the link-address field is not set to 0, the relay agent relays the message on the link identified by the link-address field. If the relay agent receives a Relay-reply message, it MUST process the message as defined above…”\n      - Section 19.3: Servers constructing Relay-reply messages are told to “set the link-address field as required by the relay agent to relay the Reconfigure message to the client.”\n      - Section 21.18: Interface-Id option semantics; Interface-Id is used precisely to identify the relay’s interface when `link-address` alone isn’t sufficient.\n    - DetailedReasoning:\n      - Section 19.2 defines a decision tree for a relay that receives a Relay-reply:\n        1. If Interface-Id is present, use it to choose the outgoing link.\n        2. Else, if `link-address != 0`, use `link-address` to choose the link.\n        3. It then says the relay “MUST process the message as defined above”.\n      - This leaves one explicit gap: the case where *both* conditions fail—i.e., the Relay-reply has no Interface-Id option and `link-address == 0`. That message is on the wire and reaches the relay, but the specification does not say what the relay MUST or SHOULD do.\n      - In a correct deployment, servers constructing Relay-reply messages are expected to always provide enough information for the relay to map the reply back to a specific client-facing link (either Interface-Id or a non-zero `link-address`); 19.3 hints at that (“set the link-address field as required by the relay agent”) but does not guarantee it in normative error-handling terms.\n      - Nevertheless, implementations must be robust against buggy or misconfigured servers or other relays that violate these assumptions and generate a Relay-reply with both Interface-Id omitted and `link-address` set to 0 (e.g., due to LDRA-like behavior accidentally applied at the wrong hop, or coding mistakes).\n      - Without explicit guidance, different relay implementations may react differently: some might attempt to guess an outgoing link based on the `peer-address`, some might flood it, and some might silently drop it. The text’s “MUST process … as defined above” does not resolve this, because “as defined above” does not say what to do if neither condition is met.\n      - Guessing the link is dangerous from a scope perspective: the Reply or Reconfigure could be delivered on the wrong link or looped, breaking the intended “return through the same relay chain” semantics of Section 19.3 and potentially confusing or misconfiguring other clients.\n      - From an interoperability and safety standpoint, the only sane behavior when the relay has *no* unambiguous link identification (no Interface-Id, `link-address == 0`) is to drop the Relay-reply and optionally log an error; but this is not stated, so the scope of valid Relay-reply messages is clear, yet the scope of required behavior for invalid Relay-replies is not.\n      - This is a classic underspecification of error handling: the base spec defines the happy-path scope (messages *with* a usable link identifier) but leaves the behavior for undeniably out-of-scope messages unspecified, inviting divergent implementations.\n      - A small clarification in Section 19.2 along the lines of “If a Relay-reply lacks both an Interface-Id option and a non-zero link-address, the relay agent MUST silently discard the message” would tighten the scope, ensure deterministic behavior across implementations, and prevent accidental misdelivery or loops. \n\n- ResidualUncertainties:\n  - It is implied, but not stated explicitly, that any server compliant with Section 19.3 will *always* supply sufficient information (Interface-Id and/or non-zero `link-address`) for every Relay-reply on every hop; if that were stated normatively, the error case in Issue-2 could be framed purely as “processing of invalid messages”. As written, that guarantee remains implicit.",

Both candidate issues are about clarity and robustness against non‑conformant peers, not about fundamental causal failure for conformant implementations.\n\n---\n\n2. Causal Analysis\n\n### Issue 1 – Interaction of §19.1.1 with LDRA behavior (RFC 6221)\n\n**What the draft says for a “normal” relay (message from a client):**\n\n- §19.1.1:  \n  If the relay received the message from a client, it:\n\n  - Puts a GUA/ULA for the client’s link into `link-address`,  \n  - If no such address is available, *may* use a link‑local address,  \n  - Sets `hop-count` to 0,  \n  - SHOULD insert a Client Link‑Layer Address option,  \n  - MUST include Interface‑Id only if it cannot otherwise identify the interface for the response.  \n\n  Note “places” and “may” are not BCP 14 terms, so §19.1.1 is descriptive guidance, not a hard MUST.\n\n**What LDRA (RFC 6221) says:**\n\n- §6.1 of RFC 6221 (LDRA relaying a client message):\n\n  - MUST set `link-address` in Relay‑forward to the unspecified address `::`.\n  - MUST include an Interface‑Id option.\n  - This is *different* from a normal relay on purpose.\n\n**What the server is told to do:**\n\n- §13.1 of the draft (server link determination):\n\n  - For relayed messages, “the client is on the same link as the one to which the interface, identified by the link-address field in the message from the relay agent, is attached.”\n  - “According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero.”  \n    And: “The link-address in this case may come from any of the Relay-forward messages encapsulated in the received Relay-forward, and in general the most encapsulated (closest Relay-forward to the client) has the most useful value.”\n\n- RFC 7969 §3.2 and RFC 6221 explain how, when `link-address == ::` (LDRA case), the server instead uses the Interface‑Id (with static config) to resolve the link.\n\n**State machine over a typical LDRA chain (C – LDRA – R – S):**\n\n1. Client → LDRA: SOLICIT to ff02::1:2.\n2. LDRA builds Relay‑forward:\n   - `link-address = ::`, `peer-address = client-LL`, Interface‑Id = port ID (per RFC 6221).\n3. Upstream relay R gets that Relay‑forward and applies §19.1.2:\n   - `peer-address` = LDRA’s source address.\n   - If LDRA uses a global address toward R, R sets `link-address = 0`; if LDRA uses only link‑local, R sets `link-address` to its own GUA/ULA on that interface or attaches its own Interface‑Id.\n4. Server S receives nested Relay‑forward(s):\n   - Innermost has `link-address = ::` and Interface‑Id (LDRA).\n   - Outermost has either non‑zero `link-address` (from R), or `0` if R used rules of §19.1.2 treating LDRA as remote.\n   - §13.1 says: ignore any `link-address == 0`, look for a non‑zero one among the encapsulations; if there’s none (LDRA‑only case), fall back to using Interface‑Id / configuration as in RFC 6221 & RFC 7969.\n\nThis is a *coherent* algorithm:\n\n- Normal relays: server uses non‑zero `link-address`.\n- LDRA: server ignores `link-address == ::` and uses Interface‑Id as specified in RFC 6221 & RFC 7969.\n\n**Is there a normative conflict?**\n\n- §19.1.1 does *not* use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT for the `link-address` choice, while RFC 6221 uses “MUST set link-address to ::”.\n- Under BCP 14, only the all‑caps words are normative; so there is no literal “MUST vs MUST NOT” conflict.\n- In practice:\n\n  - If you implement a *normal* relay following §19.1.1, you never set `link-address` to 0 for client messages; server behavior is fine.\n  - If you implement an LDRA, you follow RFC 6221 §6.1 and *do* set `link-address` to `::` and always include Interface‑Id; server is again fine because §13.1 explicitly says to ignore zero `link-address` in the LDRA case and is written with RFC 6221 in mind.\n\n**Does anything break if implementers follow both documents literally?**\n\nNo:\n\n- For a normal relay, algorithm is straightforward and consistent.\n- For an LDRA, RFC 6221’s more specific rules override the generic text in §19.1.1; §13.1 in this draft explicitly accommodates that by requiring servers to ignore `link-address = 0`.\n- Server plus relay(s) get sufficient information (non‑zero `link-address` and/or Interface‑Id) to accurately determine the client’s link and allocate “appropriate to the link” addresses/prefixes.\n\nSo Issue 1 is about cross‑document clarity (it might be nice to add a sentence in §19.1.1 saying “except as specified for LDRAs in RFC 6221, which set link-address to ::”), but the on‑wire behavior and state machines are coherent and implementable as is.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2 – Relay-reply with both link-address == 0 and no Interface-Id\n\n§19.2 says:\n\n- Relay processes a Relay‑reply as follows:\n\n  1. “The relay agent extracts the message from the Relay Message option and relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field of the Relay-reply message. Relay agents MUST NOT modify the message.”\n\n  2. “If the Relay-reply message includes an Interface-Id option, the relay agent relays the message from the server to the client on the link identified by the Interface-Id option. Otherwise, if the link-address field is not set to 0, the relay agent relays the message on the link identified by the link-address field.”\n\nThere is no explicit rule for “Interface‑Id absent and link‑address == 0”. The question is whether that situation can arise for conformant peers, and if so whether it makes the behavior unrealizable.\n\n#### Where do Relay-reply `link-address` and Interface-Id come from?\n\n- §9.2: In a Relay‑reply, the `link-address` is **copied from the Relay-forward message**.\n- §19.3: When building nested Relay‑reply chains, the server:\n\n  - Copies the `link-address` from the corresponding received Relay‑forward at each layer,\n  - Echoes Interface‑Id if present in the Relay‑forward (§18.3.10 and §21.18).\n\n- For a normal relay directly serving a client:\n  - §19.1.1 requires it to set `link-address` to a GUA/ULA for the client’s link, or if not available to a link‑local, never to `0`.\n- For an LDRA:\n  - RFC 6221 §6.1: MUST set `link-address` to `::` and MUST include Interface‑Id.  \n    §21.18 then makes the server echo that Interface‑Id in the Relay‑reply.\n\nPutting that together:\n\n- **Last hop to the client**:\n  - Normal relay: Relay‑forward has `link-address != 0`, server copies it, so Relay‑reply has non‑zero `link-address`.\n  - LDRA: Relay‑forward has `link-address == ::`, but also has Interface‑Id; server copies both, so Relay‑reply has Interface‑Id.\n  - Thus for the final hop, a conformant server+relay pair will *always* give the receiving relay either:\n    - a non‑zero `link-address`, or\n    - an Interface‑Id.\n\n- **Intermediate hop between relays** (like in the example in §19.3 / Figure 10):\n\n  - For the Relay‑reply from server to relay B (destined to pass on to relay A), the `link-address` may legitimately be 0 and there is no Interface‑Id; §19.2’s first sentence (“relays … to peer-address”) is sufficient, since B is just sending to A’s global address using normal IPv6 routing. The choice of outgoing interface is left to the IPv6 forwarding logic; there is no need for a “link identified by link-address” here.\n\nIn other words:\n\n- The supposedly “unspecified” combination (Interface‑Id absent, `link-address == 0`) *does occur* in the protocol, but only in the intermediate relay‑to‑relay case where the relay is just routing to another relay’s unicast address. In that case, the text “relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field” already gives a complete rule; the Interface‑Id / `link-address` clauses are specifically about selecting the client‑facing link when delivering the inner message to a directly attached client.\n\n- For the client‑facing hop, the undesired corner case (no Interface‑Id and `link-address == 0`) **cannot happen** if both the client‑side relay and the server are conformant, because:\n\n  - §19.1.1 forbids a normal relay from using 0 there.\n  - RFC 6221 requires an LDRA to include Interface‑Id whenever it sets `link-address` to ::.\n  - §9.2/§21.18 require the server to copy both fields through.\n\nSo there is no reachable state in the normative protocol where a conformant relay cannot figure out what to do for the final hop to the client.\n\nWhat if a server or relay is buggy/misconfigured and produces such a Relay‑reply?\n\n- Then behavior is indeed not spelled out. An implementation might drop, might guess based on peer-address, or might misdeliver. But that’s behavior in the presence of a non‑conformant peer.\n- This draft generally does *not* attempt to fully specify behavior under arbitrary protocol violations; it specifies the on‑wire protocol under the assumption participants follow the rules.\n\nFrom the perspective of “If implementers follow the text literally, do they get a working protocol?” the answer is yes; this corner case is unreachable for conformant peers, and the intermediate‑hop case (where it *is* reachable) still has well‑defined behavior via “relay to peer-address”.\n\n---\n\n3. Problem Classification\n\n- **Issue 1 (LDRA vs §19.1.1)**:  \n  Not a causal inconsistency. The combination of this draft, RFC 6221, and RFC 7969 yields a coherent, implementable algorithm for both normal relays and LDRAs. The only concern is editorial: §19.1.1 does not explicitly say “except for LDRAs per RFC 6221”, but this does not prevent correct behavior.\n\n- **Issue 2 (Relay-reply with no Interface-Id and link-address == 0)**:  \n  Not a causal underspecification for conformant peers. For the only place where that matters (last hop to client), the combination is precluded by normative text in §19.1.1, RFC 6221 §6.1, and §9.2/§21.18. For intermediate hops, §19.2’s “relay to peer-address” is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n4. Minimal Fix Shape (Optional)\n\nWhile not required for correctness, two small clarifications could improve readability and robustness:\n\n- In §19.1.1, add an explicit note such as:  \n  “For Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agents (LDRAs), see RFC 6221; an LDRA sets `link-address` to :: and uses Interface‑Id instead of a GUA/ULA.”\n\n- In §19.2, optionally add a sentence clarifying intent:  \n  “When neither an Interface-Id nor a non‑zero `link-address` is present (as in Relay-reply messages sent between non-adjacent relays), the relay forwards the packet based solely on the `peer-address` using normal IPv6 forwarding.”\n\nThese would make the intended behavior more obvious but do not change the causal behavior of conformant implementations.\n\n---\n\n5. Non-Issues\n\nSo, with respect to the core causal question — whether faithfully following this text yields a realizable, interoperable relay/server system with correct link identification and message delivery — both candidate issues are benign.",

      "analysis": "QuantitativeAnalysis:\n- ExcerptSummary: Section 19 and related definitions specify DHCPv6 relay behavior: how Relay‑forward/Relay‑reply messages are formed and nested, how the hop‑count field and the HOP_COUNT_LIMIT constant constrain multi‑relay chains, and how link‑address/peer‑address and Interface‑Id are used to identify links and return paths. Numeric constants (e.g., HOP_COUNT_LIMIT=8, IPv6 Hop Limit=8) and field semantics are central.\n\n- Issues:\n\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: Inconsistency\n    - ShortLabel: Hop-count meaning vs initial value\n    - Description: The hop-count field is defined as “number of relay agents that have already relayed this message”, but when a relay first converts a client message into a Relay-forward, it is required to set hop-count to 0. At that moment, one relay (this relay) has already processed/relayed the message, so the two specifications cannot both be literally true. This mismatch can mislead implementers about how to initialize hop-count.\n    - Evidence: The Relay message format defines: “hop-count: Number of relay agents that have already relayed this message. A 1‑octet field.” (Section 9.1/9.2). When a relay receives a message from a client, “The hop-count value in the Relay-forward message is set to 0.” (Section 19.1.1). When another relay receives a Relay-forward, it “sets the hop-count field to the value of the hop-count field in the received message incremented by 1.” (Section 19.1.2).\n    - QuantitativeReasoning: According to the definition, after the *first* relay has created the Relay-forward, the message has passed through one relay, so “number of relay agents that have already relayed this message” should be 1. The text, however, forces hop-count=0 in this case, and only subsequent relays increment it (0, 1, 2, …). Thus, in practice hop-count is “(number of relays so far) − 1”, not the number itself, contradicting the definition.\n    - Consequences: An implementer who follows the field definition rather than the procedural text may initialize hop-count to 1 for the first Relay-forward. This changes the effective hop budget by one (see Issue‑2) and can cause discrepancies in how many nested relays are allowed before a message is dropped. Even if most deployments use few relays and won’t notice, the inconsistency can cause interoperability surprises in more complex topologies and makes diagnostics of multi‑relay behavior harder.\n\n  - Issue-2:\n    - BugType: Inconsistency\n    - ShortLabel: HOP_COUNT_LIMIT off‑by‑one vs “max hop count”\n    - Description: The constant HOP_COUNT_LIMIT is defined numerically as 8 with the description “Max hop count in a Relay-forward message”, but the relay processing rule discards any incoming Relay-forward whose hop-count is *greater than or equal to* HOP_COUNT_LIMIT. As written, the maximum hop-count value a relay will accept is 7, not 8, so the prose description of HOP_COUNT_LIMIT does not match how it is applied.\n    - Evidence: Table 1 defines “HOP_COUNT_LIMIT | 8 | Max hop count in a Relay-forward message” (Section 7.6). The relay-chain rule says: “If the message received by the relay agent is a Relay-forward message and the hop-count value in the message is greater than or equal to HOP_COUNT_LIMIT, the relay agent discards the received message.” (Section 19.1.2). The first relay sets hop-count to 0 for a client-originated message (Section 19.1.1), and each subsequent relay sets hop-count := previous hop-count + 1 (Section 19.1.2).\n    - QuantitativeReasoning: With HOP_COUNT_LIMIT=8 and the “discard if hop-count ≥ HOP_COUNT_LIMIT” rule, the largest hop-count a relay will ever accept in an *incoming* Relay-forward is 7. A chain of k relays will produce an outermost hop-count of k−1. Thus:\n      - k−1 < 8 ⇒ k ≤ 8 relays are allowed.\n      - To reach hop-count=8, you would need k=9 relays; that message would be discarded on arrival at the 9th relay because 8 ≥ 8.\n      Therefore, the *maximum processed hop-count value* is actually HOP_COUNT_LIMIT−1, even though the table calls HOP_COUNT_LIMIT “Max hop count”.\n    - Consequences: The spec’s numeric behavior is unambiguous (drop on ≥HOP_COUNT_LIMIT), but the descriptive text can lead implementers to misinterpret HOP_COUNT_LIMIT as “largest hop-count you can still accept”. An implementation that instead discards only when hop-count > HOP_COUNT_LIMIT (to match that description) would permit one more relay in the chain (up to 9 instead of 8 for the default value). That would create inconsistent maximum relay depths across implementations, complicating debugging and network design for multi‑relay deployments.",

Reading the draft together with the cited external RFCs, the normative story is actually coherent and not internally contradictory, and the remaining gaps are in the realm of robustness guidance rather than true deontic bugs.\n\n      For generic relays, Section 19.1.1 says that when relaying a message from a client, “the relay agent places a globally scoped unicast address (i.e., GUA or ULA) … into the link-address field. If such an address is not available, the relay agent may set the link-address field to a link-local address …” and, if that still doesn’t allow the relay to identify the interface for the return path, it “MUST include an Interface-Id option” in the Relay-forward. KeyTextSnippets:\n      - “If the relay agent received the message to be relayed from a client, the relay agent places a globally scoped unicast address … into the link-address field. If such an address is not available, the relay agent may set the link-address field to a link-local address …” (Section 19.1.1)\n      - “If the relay agent cannot use the address in the link-address field to identify the interface through which the response to the client will be relayed, the relay agent MUST include an Interface-Id option…” (Section 19.1.1)\n\n      LDRA behavior in RFC 6221 is a specialization: an LDRA “MUST set the link-address field of the Relay-Forward message to the Unspecified Address (::) and MUST include the Interface-ID option in all DHCP Relay-Forward messages.”   Section 13.1 of the draft explicitly acknowledges this special case and constrains server behavior accordingly: “According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero.” This is a direct normative hook for the LDRA model, ensuring that link-address = :: is treated specially by servers, and that they instead rely on Interface-Id (or other mechanisms described in RFC 7969) to determine the client’s link.  \n\n      Because LDRA is a distinct relay *type* defined in a separate RFC, and the draft explicitly incorporates its semantics via the “MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero” rule, a reasonable reading is that Section 19.1.1 describes default / generic relay behavior, while RFC 6221 defines a more specific profile that overrides that default for LDRAs. There is no internal contradiction *within this document*: it never says that link-address MUST NOT be zero, only that a normal relay “places” a GUA/ULA or MAY use link-local; LDRA’s “MUST set to ::” is imposed by the separate LDRA specification. An implementation that wants to be an LDRA follows RFC 6221; a generic relay implementation follows Section 19.1.1. The server-side algorithm is consistent because the draft already states that zero-valued link-address MUST be ignored when determining the client’s link, which is exactly what LDRA requires.\n\n      On the second candidate issue, Section 19.2 defines relay processing of Relay-reply messages:\n      - The relay “extracts the message from the Relay Message option and relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field of the Relay-reply message. Relay agents MUST NOT modify the message.”\n      - “If the Relay-reply message includes an Interface-Id option … the relay agent relays the message … on the link identified by the Interface-Id option. Otherwise, if the link-address field is not set to 0, the relay agent relays the message on the link identified by the link-address field.” \n      - “If the relay agent receives a Relay-reply message, it MUST process the message as defined above, regardless of the type of message encapsulated …”  \n\n      Together with Section 9.2 (Relay-reply fields copied from Relay-forward) and Section 19.3’s worked example, this covers all correct, spec-compliant cases:\n      - For “normal” relays, the server copies a non-zero link-address from the corresponding Relay-forward, so the “link-address not set to 0” branch applies.\n      - For LDRAs, the Relay-forward has link-address = :: and includes Interface-Id; servers are required to copy Interface-Id into the Relay-reply, so the “Interface-Id present” branch applies.\n      - For multi-relay chains, the outer Relay-reply may carry link-address = 0 (as in Figure 10), but in that case the relay is forwarding to another relay (peer-address = address of the next relay) and can route based on peer-address, not link-address, which is already mandated by “relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field.”\n\n      A Relay-reply that simultaneously has link-address = 0 *and* no Interface-Id is therefore an on-the-wire artifact of a non-conformant server or relay. The specification does not explicitly state “MUST drop such a Relay-reply”, but it does fully define behavior for all conformant senders. The absence of a mandated error-handling rule for this clearly erroneous case is a robustness gap, not a protocol inconsistency: different implementations might choose to log and drop, or to attempt a best-effort route using only peer-address, but that does not threaten interoperability when both ends implement the spec correctly.\n\n      Overall, the normative structure for relays and servers — including LDRA interaction and multi-relay chains — is coherent and implementable. Any perceived tension in 19.1.1 vs. RFC 6221 is resolved by Section 13.1’s explicit reference to LDRA behavior and by the usual IETF pattern where an extension RFC defines stricter behavior for a subset of nodes. The missing explicit “MUST drop malformed Relay-reply with link-address = 0 and no Interface-Id” is an opportunity for stronger robustness guidance, but not a deontic bug in the sense of a conflicting or incomplete requirement for correct operation.\n    - KeyTextSnippets:\n      - “According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero.” (Section 13.1)\n      - “If the relay agent received the message to be relayed from a client, the relay agent places a globally scoped unicast address … into the link-address field. If such an address is not available, the relay agent may set the link-address field to a link-local address …” (Section 19.1.1)\n      - “If a server communicates with a client through a relay agent about delegated prefixes, the server may need a protocol or other out-of-band communication to configure routing information…” (Section 19.1.3 – showing relay/server roles are carefully scoped)\n      - “The relay agent extracts the message from the Relay Message option and relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field of the Relay-reply message. Relay agents MUST NOT modify the message.” (Section 19.2)\n      - “If the Relay-reply message includes an Interface-Id option … Otherwise, if the link-address field is not set to 0, the relay agent relays the message on the link identified by the link-address field.” (Section 19.2)\n      - Worked nested Relay-reply example (Figure 10 in Section 19.3), illustrating link-address = 0 at outer level and non-zero link-address at inner level.\n    - Impact:\n      Because the obligations for correct relay and server behavior are unambiguous for all valid protocol flows, interoperable implementations can be built without confusion. LDRA behavior is explicitly accommodated on the server side, and relays have clear rules for constructing and processing Relay-forward/Relay-reply messages in all conformant cases. The only unaddressed corner (malformed Relay-reply from a non-conformant peer) affects robustness but not interoperability between correct implementations, so it does not rise to the level of a normative bug.",

The focus was on Relay-forward/Relay-reply structure, hop-count vs Hop Limit, link-address/peer-address semantics, and Relay Message nesting (e.g., the multi‑relay example in Figure 10).\n- OverallBugLikelihood: None\n\nIssues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: None\n    - ShortLabel: No structural or syntactic issues detected\n    - TechnicalExplanation: |\n        The Relay-forward / Relay-reply header format in Figure 3 matches the textual field definitions (1‑octet msg-type and hop-count, 16‑octet link-address and peer-address, followed by options) and the “34 octets less than the size of the message” calculation for the options area is consistent with this header size. The Relay Message option (Section 21.10) correctly encapsulates either a client/server message or another relay message and is used consistently by Sections 19.1–19.3, including the multi-relay example in Figure 10, where hop-count and link-address/peer-address values align with the rules in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 19.1.1, and 19.1.2.  \n\n        The treatment of link-address and Interface-Id is structurally consistent across sections: Section 19.1.1 defines how a relay from a client populates link-address and when it MUST add Interface-Id; Section 19.1.2 defines how an intermediate relay sets link-address to 0 in the multi-hop case; and Section 13.1 (together with RFC 7969 and RFC 6221) explicitly instructs servers to ignore link-address fields whose value is zero and to use the most-inner non‑zero link-address or Interface-Id, which matches the multi-relay construction in Section 19.3.  \n\n        Relay behavior for unknown message types (Section 19’s opening paragraph) is restricted to messages other than Relay-forward and Relay-reply and is therefore applicable only to client-originated messages, which is compatible with the client/server validation rules in Section 16 and the generic relay-forwarding rules in Section 19.1. The use of Hop Limit (IPv6 header) versus hop-count (DHCP relay header) and the constant HOP_COUNT_LIMIT is clearly distinguished and internally consistent. I did not find any contradictions between diagrams, field definitions, option formats, or the described relay processing steps that would make the protocol unimplementable or structurally ambiguous.",

      "analysis": "CrossRFCReport:\n- ExcerptSummary: Section 19 of the rfc8415bis draft defines base DHCPv6 relay-agent behavior: how relays select server destinations, construct Relay-forward/Relay-reply chains, fill link-address and peer-address, and use options such as Interface-Id and Client Link-Layer Address. It references RFC6221 (LDRA), RFC7969, RFC6939, RFC4994, and RFC6422 for specific relay-related mechanisms, and Section 13 describes how servers interpret relay information including link-address and Interface-Id.\n- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Low\n- Issues: []\n- IfNoIssues:\n  - Comment: The router hypothesis focuses on a possible conflict or ambiguity between Section 19.1.1’s description of link-address handling and LDRA behavior in RFC6221, plus server-side interpretation in Section 13.1 and RFC7969.\n\n    Looking closely at the text and the referenced RFCs, there is no real cross-RFC inconsistency:\n\n    * Section 19.1 explicitly acknowledges LDRA: it introduces relay behavior and then immediately points to RFC6221 as defining an LDRA that inserts relay information on a purely L2 node. RFC6221 Section 6.1 requires that an LDRA set link-address to the unspecified address (::) and include an Interface-Id option.    \n\n    * Section 19.1.1 in the draft describes what a “normal” relay does for messages received directly from a client: it “places a globally scoped unicast address (GUA or ULA)” in link-address, and “may” fall back to a link-local address, citing RFC7969 Section 3.2 for the (less recommended) link-local case.    The wording here deliberately avoids BCP 14 keywords; there is no “MUST” that would forbid the LDRA’s “MUST set link-address to ::” rule in RFC6221. RFC6221 therefore cleanly overrides this generic guidance for the LDRA case.\n\n    * Section 13.1 ties the server’s view together with RFC6221 and RFC7969: it says that when a server receives a message from a forwarding relay, “According to [RFC6221], the server MUST ignore any link-address field whose value is zero.”    RFC7969 §3.2 explains that in LDRA deployments the relay sets link-address to :: and uses Interface-Id for precise link identification.    That is exactly consistent with the “ignore link-address = 0, use Interface-Id” model.\n\n    * Section 19.1.2 (relaying a message from another relay) reproduces the RFC 8415 behavior: if a relay receives a Relay-forward and the outer IPv6 source address is GUA/ULA, it sets link-address to 0; otherwise it uses a GUA/ULA or Interface-Id.    RFC7969 §3.2 describes and relies on this same pattern for multi-relay topologies (outer relays with link-address 0, inner relay nearer the client with a meaningful link-address or Interface-Id).    Section 13.1’s “MUST ignore any link-address whose value is zero” is fully consistent with the idea that only non-zero link-address values (typically the innermost) are used to determine the client’s link, while LDRA cases depend on Interface-Id alone.\n\n    * RFC6221 §6.1’s LDRA rules (link-address ::, mandatory Interface-Id) fit cleanly into this framework. The LDRA is a specialized relay defined by its own RFC; implementers of an LDRA will follow RFC6221’s explicit MUSTs. Base relays follow Section 19.1.1’s guidance, which is non-BCP14 descriptive text and so does not conflict with RFC6221’s stricter requirements.\n\n    * Unknown message handling is also consistent: Section 19 states that if a relay receives a non-Relay-forward / non-Relay-reply message with an unrecognized message type, it MUST forward it per 19.1.1.    This aligns with RFC7283’s requirement that relays forward unknown message types rather than discarding them.\n\n    * The references to RFC6939 (Client Link-Layer Address option), RFC4994 (Echo Request option), and RFC6422 (relay-supplied options) use the correct option names and are consistent with those RFCs’ semantics: Section 19.1.1 says the relay “SHOULD insert a Client Link-Layer Address option as described in [RFC6939]”, and Section 19.4 describes server echoing of relay options and relay-supplied options using the right RFC references and behaviors.      \n\n    In summary, taken together, Section 13.1, Section 19 (especially 19.1.1/19.1.2 and 19.4), RFC6221, and RFC7969 form a coherent relay/LDRA model. There is room for editorial improvement — for example, 19.1.1 could explicitly say “for non-LDRA relays; LDRA behavior is specified in RFC6221” — but the current text does not create normative conflicts or registry mismatches that would plausibly lead to non-interoperable implementations.",

This matches the definition in 9.1/9.2 and the usage in 19.2/19.3.\n        - `link-address` is consistently described as an address used by the *server* to identify the client’s link (9.1 and 13.1), and the relay-fill rules in 19.1.1 and 19.1.2 are aligned with that purpose.\n      - The interaction with LDRAs does not introduce a naming or terminological contradiction:\n        - The bis draft keeps the generic rule (“GUA/ULA, or possibly link-local”) for a normal relay’s `link-address` (19.1.1), while explicitly pointing to RFC 7969 and, more importantly, requiring the server to ignore `link-address == 0` in accordance with RFC 6221 (13.1). This is exactly the mechanism LDRAs rely on.\n        - Thus, the term and field name `link-address` is used consistently even in the LDRA special case—its semantics are effectively “address for link identification, or zero when identification must come from Interface-Id / LDRA context”.\n      - The naming of options is uniform:\n        - “Relay Message option” and OPTION_RELAY_MSG, “Interface-Id option” and OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, and “Client Link-Layer Address option” and OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR all line up with their respective formal definitions.\n        - The draft consistently uses “Relay-forward message” / “Relay-reply message” as prose names for the message types RELAY-FORW (12) and RELAY-REPL (13), as already established in Section 7.3, without inventing any conflicting labels.\n      - Minor stylistic variations (e.g., “Interface-Id” vs “Interface-ID” in quoted external text) are clearly traceable to different source RFCs and refer to the same option code; they are not ambiguous within this document.\n      - Because of this, there is no realistic scenario where an implementer would mis-encode fields, look up the wrong option, or confuse the meaning of `link-address`, `peer-address`, or `Interface-Id` based on the naming/terminology in Section 19 or its cross-references.\n    - PatchSuggestion:\n      - None.\n\n- Notes:\n  - UsedRouterIssues: Reviewed the router’s hints about possible inconsistencies in the use of `link-address`, `peer-address`, `Interface-Id`, the LDRA special case, and the Client Link-Layer Address option.

That would matter specifically for the *final* relay that has to choose which link to use to reach the client.\n      - However, the last-hop Relay-forward (from the relay directly attached to the client) is constrained:\n        - A “normal” relay following 19.1.1 never uses 0 in link-address; it must choose a GUA/ULA from a prefix for the client’s link or, failing that, a link-local address from that interface  .\n        - An LDRA *must* use link-address = :: *but* is also required to include an Interface-Id option in all Relay-forward messages it generates  .\n      - Section 9.2 then requires the server to copy link-address (and peer-address) from that last-hop Relay-forward into the corresponding Relay-reply header  . Section 21.18 requires the server to copy Interface-Id if present  .\n      - Consequently, for a compliant server and a compliant last-hop relay:\n        - Normal relay case: last-hop Relay-reply necessarily has link-address ≠ 0 (copied from the non-zero link-address in the Relay-forward).\n        - LDRA case: last-hop Relay-reply necessarily has Interface-Id present (copied from the Relay-forward) even though link-address is 0.\n      - The only way the final relay could see a Relay-reply with both link-address=0 and no Interface-Id is if some upstream entity (server or relay) is already violating the normative requirements (e.g., failing to copy Interface-Id or mis-setting link-address). The specification generally does not attempt to normatively constrain behavior under arbitrary protocol violations; it only needs to be clear for valid on-the-wire states.\n      - For intermediate relays in a multi-relay chain, the outer Relay-reply headers *do* frequently have link-address=0 and may lack Interface-Id (as in the example in 19.3), but those relays do not use link-address/Interface-Id to select the outgoing link; they simply “extract the message from the Relay Message option and rel[ay] it to the address contained in the peer-address field” (the previous relay)  . In that role, the ambiguity doesn’t arise.\n    - ImpactAssessment:\n      - Since the “link-address=0 and no Interface-Id” combination cannot occur for the final-hop relay if all entities are conformant, the lack of explicit behavior for that combination does not affect interoperability between compliant implementations. Implementations may reasonably drop such malformed Relay-reply messages as a robustness measure, but the spec’s silence here is about behavior in the presence of already-noncompliant peers, not about a reachable boundary in the specified state space.\n\n- Notes:\n  - Not a bug, but a subtle point: Section 19.2’s description of Relay-reply processing mixes the generic “extract and relay to peer-address” step (used at every relay hop, including intermediate ones) with the special-case logic for selecting the outgoing *link* (using Interface-Id or link-address) when the relay is directly attached to the client. The multi-relay example in 19.3 clarifies the intended behavior and keeps this from being inconsistent, but the layering is a bit implicit rather than explicit.",
