### Expert Analysis:

TemporalAnalysis:
  HighLevelSummary: |
    The excerpt’s “constants” (multicast addresses, UDP ports, message types, timers, and time encodings) are largely consistent with the later behavioral sections: retransmission algorithms, T1/T2 handling, and client/server exchanges line up coherently in time. The main temporal concern is the interaction of the fixed-port rules in Section 7.2 with the Relay Source Port behavior from RFC 8357, which requires servers and relays to remember and reuse non‑standard source ports over the lifetime of a flow. This creates an apparent normative conflict and an underspecified handoff between the base spec’s port rules and RFC 8357’s stateful behavior.
  OverallTemporalRisk: Low
  CandidateIssues:
    - Id: T1
      Type: Both
      ShortLabel: "UDP port 547 rules vs Relay Source Port Option behavior over time"
      Description: |
        Section 7.2 prescribes a fixed temporal pattern for where replies are sent: clients always receive on port 546 and relays/servers always receive on 547; replies are always sent to those fixed destination ports. RFC 8357, however, explicitly changes this behavior so that servers and upstream relays must remember the UDP source port used by a downstream relay and send replies back to that varying port, not always to 547. The bis draft only briefly notes that the Relay Source Port Option “changes some of these rules” but does not clearly spell out the resulting ordering/state behavior (when to learn the port, how long to remember it, and in which cases the 7.2 MUSTs no longer apply). As written, an implementation that follows 7.2 literally and is also trying to be RFC 8357‑compliant cannot satisfy both sets of rules at once, and the temporal evolution of “which port do I send to now?” is ambiguous.
      TemporalReasoning: |
        - Section 7.2 defines the baseline exchange pattern:
          - Clients MUST listen on UDP destination port 546; servers and relay agents MUST listen on 547.
          - Consequently: “clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547. Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546. Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546.”
        - This describes, over time, a stable mapping: any server→relay traffic uses dest port 547, and any relay→server traffic uses dest port 547; this does not change as a function of prior packets.
        - RFC 8357’s relay source port mechanism changes this by introducing per-peer temporal state: when a server receives a message from a relay using some UDP source port P, it MUST remember (IP address, P) and, for subsequent replies (Relay‑reply) destined back to that peer, it must use P as the destination port rather than the fixed 547. Likewise, in cascaded relay topologies, upstream relays must remember and reuse the downstream relay’s source port for their replies.
        - The bis text acknowledges this only with: “Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.” Yet the normative text just above still says “Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547” and “Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547,” without conditioning those MUSTs on “unless using RFC 8357”.
        - Over the lifetime of a relay/server interaction, RFC 8357 requires that “learned source port” state persist and alter later send behavior, while 7.2 describes send behavior as stateless and always tied to 547. That’s a direct conflict in the temporal evolution of send destinations unless one spec is understood to override the other explicitly.
        - Because the bis draft does not normatively describe when these MUSTs cease to apply (e.g., “except when a Relay Source Port Option is in effect, in which case the remembered port MUST be used instead of 547”), an implementer following only this document could send all Relay-reply packets to 547, breaking the RFC 8357 flows, or could violate the explicit MUSTs in 7.2.
      KeyEvidence:
        ExcerptPoints:
          - “Clients MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 546. Servers and relay agents MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 547. Therefore, clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547. Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546. Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546.” (Section 7.2)
          - “It is RECOMMENDED for clients to send messages from UDP source port 546, and servers and relay agents from UDP source port 547. However, clients, servers, and relay agents MAY send DHCP messages from any UDP source port they are allowed to use.” (Section 7.2)
          - “Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.” (Section 7.2)
        ContextPoints:
          - RFC 8357 summary: server must remember the inbound packet’s UDP source port along with the relay’s address and “when sending back replies, the DHCP server MUST use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number… the upstream relay agent needs to use the Relay Source Port Option to record the downstream source port, and it MUST use this recorded port number instead of the fixed DHCP port number when replaying the reply messages.”
      ImpactOnImplementations: |
        Implementations that only read 7.2 may hard-code sending all Relay-reply messages to destination port 547 and ignore any per-peer source port learned state, causing failure when interacting with RFC 8357‑style relays that expect replies on a non‑547 port. Implementations that try to honor RFC 8357 but also take the Section 7.2 MUSTs literally are in a deontic bind: they must either violate 7.2’s unconditional MUST‑to‑547 or violate RFC 8357’s “MUST use the learned port” requirement. The lack of a clear, time‑ordered rule like “initially send to 547, but once a Relay Source Port Option has been seen for a given peer, all subsequent replies for that peer MUST go to the recorded port” makes the port‑selection state machine underspecified and risks interoperability bugs in multi‑process relay deployments that RFC 8357 is specifically meant to support.
      AffectedArtifacts:
        - "Section 7.2: UDP Ports (all normative sentences about destination ports)"
        - "Implicit interaction with RFC 8357 Relay Source Port Option behavior"
      Severity: Medium

    - Id: T2
      Type: Underspecification
      ShortLabel: "Use of 'infinity' for T1/T2 and lifetimes over very long timescales"
      Description: |
        The representation of “infinity” as 0xffffffff for lifetimes and T1/T2 is internally consistent, and later sections rely on it to suppress Renew/Rebind activity. However, when T1/T2 or lifetimes are set to this value, the temporal behavior of the system becomes effectively static: clients will never renew or rebind those IAs within any realistic deployment horizon. The document warns operators to “take care” with such values but does not give any more specific temporal guidance or upper bounds relative to renumbering or operational changes. This leaves the long‑term ordering of renewals, renumbering, and configuration changes underspecified in deployments that use “infinite” values heavily.
      TemporalReasoning: |
        - Section 7.7 establishes that all lifetimes, T1, and T2 are 32‑bit unsigned integers in seconds, and that 0xffffffff means “infinity” when used for lifetimes or T1/T2.
        - It then states explicitly: “A client will never attempt to extend the lifetimes of any addresses in an IA with T1 set to 0xffffffff” and “A client will never attempt to use a Rebind message… in an IA with T2 set to 0xffffffff.”
        - Sections 21.4 and 21.21 recommend that when the “shortest” preferred lifetime in an IA is 0xffffffff, T1 and T2 should also be set to 0xffffffff, reinforcing this “never renew, never rebind” behavior for such IAs.
        - Over time, this means that once a client configures addresses or prefixes with infinite lifetimes and infinite T1/T2, the only temporal events affecting those bindings are external: administrator‑triggered Reconfigure messages (if supported and negotiated) or manual reconfiguration. There is no protocol‑driven refresh or check‑in.
        - While this may be acceptable for truly permanent static allocations, the document’s only guidance is “Care should be taken” when setting T1/T2 to infinity; it does not tie that warning to any concrete temporal best practices (e.g., “even with infinity you SHOULD plan to renumber by doing X every Y years”, or “SHOULD NOT use 0xffffffff for T1/T2 unless…”) or to the renumbering considerations in Neighbor Discovery.
      KeyEvidence:
        ExcerptPoints:
          - “All time values for lifetimes, T1, and T2 are unsigned 32-bit integers and are expressed in units of seconds. The value 0xffffffff is taken to mean ‘infinity’ when used as a lifetime… or a value for T1 or T2.” (Section 7.7)
          - “Care should be taken in setting T1 or T2 to 0xffffffff (‘infinity’). A client will never attempt to extend the lifetimes of any addresses in an IA with T1 set to 0xffffffff. A client will never attempt to use a Rebind message to locate a different server to extend the lifetimes of any addresses in an IA with T2 set to 0xffffffff.” (Section 7.7)
          - “If the ‘shortest’ preferred lifetime is 0xffffffff (‘infinity’), the recommended T1 and T2 values are also 0xffffffff.” (Section 21.4, analogously in 21.21)
        ContextPoints:
          - Neighbor Discovery renumbering guidance that warns about infinite lifetimes requiring long‑term continued advertising of prefixes to force deprecation   
      ImpactOnImplementations: |
        Implementations that follow the recommendation to use 0xffffffff for T1/T2 alongside infinite lifetimes will never initiate Renew/Rebind for those IAs, effectively freezing the binding until manual intervention or Reconfigure, if any. While this is not an internal contradiction, the lack of concrete temporal guidance can lead operators to overuse “infinite” values without realizing that they eliminate any automatic refresh path, complicating future renumbering or policy changes. Different implementations may choose divergent operational “best practices” around when, if ever, to revisit such bindings, leading to ecosystem variance in long‑term behavior.
      AffectedArtifacts:

    - RelatedIssueId: "Issue-1"
    - Assessment: StrongEvidenceOfBug
    - BugType: Both
    - Summary: >
        Section 7.2 assigns servers a hard requirement to send all Relay‑reply messages
        to UDP destination port 547, while RFC 8357 requires a server (and, with cascaded relays,
        upstream relays) to send replies back to the relay’s actual source port, which may be
        non‑547. The only bridge is a vague sentence that RFC 8357 “changes some of these rules”
        without stating that the preceding MUST is conditional. This creates a normative conflict
        on server send behavior when RFC 8357 is in use, and also leaves the altered responsibilities
        of servers and relays under‑specified.
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - "Clients MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 546.  Servers and relay agents MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 547."
        - "Therefore, clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547.  Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546."
        - "Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546."
        - "However, clients, servers, and relay agents MAY send DHCP messages from any UDP source port they are allowed to use."
        - "Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents."
        - From RFC 8357: "When sending back replies, the DHCP server MUST use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number. In the case of IPv6-cascaded relay agents ... the upstream relay agent ... MUST use this recorded port number instead of the fixed DHCP port number when replaying the reply messages."
      - Reasoning: >
          Within this draft, roles and directions are clear: relays and servers listen on 547,
          clients on 546; servers “MUST send Relay‑reply messages to UDP destination port 547,” and
          relays “MUST send Relay‑forward and Relay‑reply messages to UDP destination port 547” toward servers.
          The text also explicitly allows arbitrary *source* ports, which is compatible with RFC 8357’s
          relaxation of the fixed source port on relays. The conflict arises on the *destination* port
          for server‑to‑relay traffic: RFC 8357 requires that the server’s reply be sent to the port
          number that the relay actually used as its source, which may differ from 547, while Section 7.2
          unconditionally mandates 547 as the destination for all Relay‑reply messages.
          The trailing sentence that the Relay Source Port Option “changes some of these rules”
          does not say that the preceding MUST is overridden when RFC 8357 is in use, nor does it specify
          the new obligation (“server MUST send Relay‑reply to the relay’s recorded source port”).
          An implementer aiming to comply with both documents cannot satisfy both “Servers MUST send
          Relay‑reply messages to UDP destination port 547” and “MUST use the UDP port number that the
          incoming relay agent uses,” making this both a cross‑RFC inconsistency in the assigned role
          (server’s choice of destination port) and an underspecified exception path for the RFC 8357 case.

- AdditionalActorIssues:
  - NewIssue-1:
    - BugType: Underspecification
    - Summary: >
        The phrase “Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination
        port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546” uses “client messages” without
        explicitly stating that these are messages sent *to* clients (not messages in which the relay
        acts as a client of a server), which could momentarily confuse the directionality of that rule.
        While the intended meaning is inferable from the rest of the document, making this explicit
        would tighten the role/direction assignment for relays.
    - Evidence:
      - "Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546."
      - Reasoning: >
          In the surrounding text, relays serve as intermediaries: they send Relay‑forward/Relay‑reply
          upstream to servers and send decapsulated “client messages” downstream to clients.
          The bare term “client messages” here relies on implicit understanding that this means
          “messages sent by the relay to a DHCP client,” i.e., relay→client traffic, not messages
          where the relay itself is a client of another DHCP entity.
          Although the rest of Sections 19.1–19.2 clarify that relays “relay [the] message to the client”
          using peer‑address and do not themselves behave as DHCP clients, making this directional wording
          explicit (e.g., “messages that the relay sends to clients MUST use destination port 546”)
          would avoid any transient ambiguity about which actor/role that clause applies to.

## Scope Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ScopeAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 7 defines global protocol “constants” for DHCPv6: multicast group membership, UDP ports and port usage, message type codes, option and status code handling, retransmission parameters, and time-value encoding (including infinity). These are then referenced throughout the client, server, and relay behavior sections, and must coexist with extensions like RFC 8357.
- ScopeModel:
  - Targets:
    - Multicast addresses: ff02::1:2 for *clients → servers/relays* on-link; ff05::1:3 for *relays → servers* within a site, with all servers (and, for ff02::1:2, relays) on relevant interfaces required to join the groups.
    - UDP ports: clients as receivers on port 546; servers and relays as receivers on port 547; senders (client/server/relay) are told which destination port to use for each direction (client vs relay/server).
    - Message types: fixed numeric codes for each base DHCPv6 message; additional codes are delegated to the IANA registry.
    - Status codes: a shared code space with a default of Success when no Status Code option is present in a context where it “could appear”.
    - Retransmission constants (SOL_MAX_DELAY, SOL_TIMEOUT, SOL_MAX_RT, etc.) as defaults for the client and server retransmission algorithms described in Sections 14–15 and 18.
    - Time representation: all on‑the‑wire lifetimes, T1, and T2 as 32‑bit seconds, with 0xffffffff meaning “infinity” for those fields, including for IA lifetimes and the information refresh timer.
  - Conditions:
    - UDP port rules are stated as unconditional MUSTs for who listens where and to which destination port each role MUST send each class of message; only at the end of 7.2 is there a brief caveat that “the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relay agents.”
    - Retransmission constants are defaults unless overridden per-interface by SOL_MAX_RT/INF_MAX_RT options in server Replies.
    - Infinity semantics apply only to lifetimes and T1/T2 (not to every time variable in the spec).
    - Status Code default-to-success applies only in messages/containers where a Status Code option “could appear”.
  - NotedAmbiguities:
    - The phrase “changes some of these rules” in 7.2 is not tied to any specific subset of the preceding MUSTs; it’s left to the reader to infer *which* port-usage rules are relaxed when RFC 8357 is in use.
    - The table in 7.6 is broadly described as “used to describe the message transmission behavior of clients and servers” but does not explicitly scope itself to only the messages defined in this base document (extensions like LEASEQUERY define their own timers).

- CandidateIssues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Both
    - ShortLabel: UDP destination-port rules in §7.2 are stated as unconditional MUSTs, but RFC 8357 requires different destination ports for some server/relay exchanges; the intended conditional scope is only implicit.
    - ScopeProblemType: Wrong conditionality / missing “except when RFC 8357 applies” around global port rules (server↔relay traffic).
    - Evidence:
      - The bis draft’s §7.2 says (paraphrased): “Clients MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 546. Servers and relay agents MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 547. Therefore, clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547. Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546. Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546. ... Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.”
      - RFC 8357 explicitly relaxes the fixed-port behavior for relay↔server and relay↔relay traffic: relay agents implementing the extension “may be configured instead to 1) use a source port number other than 547 when relaying messages toward servers and 2) receive responses toward clients on that same port” , and “when an IPv6 server receives a Relay-forward message with the ‘Relay Source Port Option’, it MUST … use the UDP source port from the UDP packet of the Relay-forward message in replying to the relay agent. When a relay agent receives a Relay-reply message with the ‘Relay Source Port Option’ … if the ‘Downstream Source Port’ field … is non-zero, it MUST use this UDP port number to forward the Relay-reply message to the downstream relay agent.” 
    - DetailedReasoning:
      - Section 7.2 defines global port behavior with strong, unconditional language: all servers and relay agents MUST listen on 547, and all senders MUST use 547 as the destination for Relay-forward/Relay-reply and 546 for client-directed messages, with no explicit exceptions in the normative sentences.
      - RFC 8357’s purpose is to “relax the fixed UDP source port requirement for the DHCP relay agents” and requires that when a relay uses a non‑547 source port (and signals it via the Relay Source Port Option), the server and upstream relays MUST send their replies *to that non‑standard port* instead of 547 .
      - In practical terms, under RFC 8357, server→relay and relay→downstream‑relay traffic may legitimately use destination ports other than 547. That directly contradicts the literal reading of the 8415bis text: “Servers MUST send Relay‑reply messages to UDP destination port 547” and “Relay agents MUST send Relay‑forward and Relay‑reply messages to UDP destination port 547”.
      - The bis draft attempts to acknowledge this by a final informational sentence: “Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.” However, this is non‑normative and does not clarify *which* preceding MUSTs become conditional (e.g., only the destination-port rules for Relay‑reply, not the listening requirements), nor does it restate the conditioned behavior.
      - As a result, an implementer reading only 8415bis might conclude that sending Relay‑reply messages to any destination port other than 547 is forbidden, even when implementing RFC 8357, or may be unsure whether they are allowed to honor the port learned via the Relay Source Port Option. This is a classic scope problem: the normative rules are written as universally applicable, but the intended applicability is “except when interacting with a relay using RFC 8357 non‑standard ports”.
      - Conversely, an implementer who follows RFC 8357 and sends some Relay‑reply messages to non‑547 ports is, strictly speaking, violating the unconditional MUSTs in 7.2. The document text implicitly expects implementers to silently treat RFC 8357 as “overriding” those MUSTs for the affected flows, but that precedence is never spelled out.
      - The root cause is that the scope of the port‑usage rules in 7.2 is not explicitly qualified. A clearer formulation would bound their application (for example, “unless otherwise specified by an extension such as RFC 8357, servers MUST send Relay‑reply messages to destination port 547” and “when RFC 8357 is in use, servers and relays MUST follow the destination port selection rules in that document for any relay path that signaled a non‑standard port”).
      - This is both an inconsistency (between two normative specifications) and an underspecification of scope (the draft does not precisely identify which rules are superseded and under what conditions), and it is materially relevant for correct interoperation of servers and cascaded relays that implement RFC 8357.

- ResidualUncertainties:
  - The draft’s authors clearly intend to remain compatible with RFC 8357 and try to signal this via the note at the end of 7.2, but it is not obvious whether they also intend to *require* all servers and relay agents to listen on 547 even when they make use of non‑standard ports. The text could be read either as “MUST always also listen on 547” or “MUST listen on 547 in the base case; 8357 may relax that too,” and this is not fully clarified.

## Causal Expert

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Summary**

Following Section 7.2 literally, without RFC 8357, is fully executable and interoperable. When RFC 8357 is also implemented, the combination is still mechanically well defined, because 7.2 explicitly defers to RFC 8357. There is no fundamental break; at most this is a clarity / cross‑reference issue, not a causal inconsistency.

2. **Causal Analysis**

**Baseline per 7.2 (no RFC 8357):**

- Clients:
  - MUST listen on UDP port 546.
  - MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547.

- Servers and relays:
  - MUST listen on UDP port 547.
  - Servers MUST send:
    - Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547.
    - “Client messages” (e.g., Reply, Reconfigure) to UDP destination port 546.
  - Relay agents MUST send:
    - Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547.
    - Client messages to UDP destination port 546.

- All parties:
  - MAY use any UDP *source* port they’re allowed to use.

Mechanically, this yields a consistent state machine: every role knows exactly what dest port to use for each peer type, and at least one process on each node listens on 546 (client) or 547 (server/relay).

**Effect of RFC 8357**

RFC 8357 introduces a generalization *only* for relay–server communication:

> “This document defines an extension to relax the fixed UDP source port requirement for the DHCP relay agents. This extension requires a DHCP server to remember the inbound packet's UDP port number … When sending back replies, the DHCP server MUST use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number.”    

and, for cascaded relays:

> “…the upstream relay agent needs to use the "Relay Source Port Option" … and it MUST use this recorded port number instead of the fixed DHCP port number when replaying the reply messages.”    

So with RFC 8357 in use:

- A downstream relay may send Relay-forward from any source port `P` it has bound.
- The server MUST send the Relay-reply back to destination port `P`, not hard‑coded 547.
- For cascaded relays, the upstream relay uses the Relay Source Port option to propagate and honor a non‑547 port.

Section 7.2 in this draft *explicitly acknowledges* this:

> “Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.”  

Thus, when RFC 8357 is implemented, the “MUST send Relay-reply to UDP destination port 547” rule in 7.2 is read as the default rule, overridden in the specific case where RFC 8357 is used. RFC 8357 then provides precise, normative instructions about what to do instead.

**Is there an unimplementable or ambiguous path?**

- If an implementer **does not implement RFC 8357**, 7.2 is completely self‑consistent. All relays and servers use and expect dest port 547. No failure.

- If an implementer **does implement RFC 8357**, they are explicitly told in 7.2 that some of the port‑usage rules are changed by RFC 8357, and RFC 8357 then states, normatively, to use the relay’s source port instead of the fixed 547. There is no gap: the behavior is fully specified in 8357.

- The requirement that servers/relays “MUST listen” on 547 is not in conflict with RFC 8357:
  - A process can listen on 547 *and* on additional ports (for per‑process sockets); 7.2 does not forbid additional listening ports.
  - In the multi‑process architecture 8357 is motivated by, a single front-end can satisfy the “MUST listen on 547” while per‑process sockets use other ports for server communication. That’s an implementation detail, not a protocol contradiction.

The only apparent tension is purely textual: 7.2 says “Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547” while RFC 8357 says “MUST use the … port number … instead of the fixed DHCP port number”. But 7.2 immediately qualifies its own rules by pointing to RFC 8357 as an exception. In IETF practice, the more specific extension (8357) governs in the extended case. An implementer who claims conformance to both *cannot* simultaneously hard‑code 547 for all Relay‑reply traffic and also satisfy RFC 8357; to claim 8357 conformance they must follow 8357’s rule in that context. The draft text already signals that.

Crucially, there is no scenario where:
- A party follows 7.2 *and* correctly follows 8357 and ends up with an undefined or impossible state; or
- A party following 7.2 alone becomes non‑interoperable with a peer that is not using 8357.

Any breakage arises only if an implementer claims RFC 8357 support but ignores its normative requirement to use the relay’s source port; that breakage is due to violating RFC 8357, not ambiguity in this draft.

---

3. **Problem Classification**

- **Causal Inconsistency:** No. The combined behavior of 7.2 and RFC 8357 yields an implementable, coherent set of rules. There is no path where the protocol becomes unrealizable or self‑contradictory at runtime if the specifications are followed as written.

- **Causal Underspecification:** Also no in a strict sense. For deployments that use RFC 8357, the behavior is fully defined *in RFC 8357 itself*, and 7.2 explicitly defers to it. This draft does not need to restate 8357’s rules for the system to be implementable.

The issue is best viewed as **non‑causal, editorial clarity**: 7.2’s phrase “changes some of these rules” is vague, and an implementer reading only 7.2 without opening RFC 8357 will not know *which* rules change. But that does not create a mechanistic gap; correct implementers are expected to read RFC 8357 to support its option.

---

4. **Minimal Fix Shape (Optional)**

If the WG wants to reduce the chance of misinterpretation, a small local tweak to 7.2 would suffice, e.g.:

- Change the Relay‑reply sentence to something like:
  - “Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547, **except when the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] is in use, in which case they MUST send to the port indicated by RFC 8357.**”

and similarly for relay behavior. This would make the override explicit but is not required to restore causal correctness.

---

5. **Non-Issues**

- The fact that 7.2 still mandates that servers and relays “MUST listen” on 547 does **not** break 8357; 8357 changes the *reply port selection*, not the existence of the well‑known port.
- Deployments that never use RFC 8357 are unaffected and operate correctly with the fixed ports in 7.2.
- Deployments that use RFC 8357 and implement its normative text correctly will interoperate fine; the draft’s pointer to 8357 is sufficient to avoid a conflicting requirement at the behavioral level.

## Quantitative Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QuantitativeAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary:  
  The excerpt defines DHCPv6 “constants” and related structures: multicast addresses, UDP ports and port usage, message type numbers, option layouts and lengths, retransmission timers and backoff bounds, and 32‑bit time value semantics including the use of 0xffffffff to represent “infinity”. These constants are then referenced throughout the client, server, and relay algorithms, and are summarized again in Appendix B’s option/message‑type tables.

- Issues:

  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: INF_MAX_RT use in Advertise vs Appendix B table
    - Description: The normative text explicitly allows (and even expects) the INF_MAX_RT option to appear in Advertise messages and requires clients to process it, but Appendix B’s summary table only marks INF_MAX_RT as valid in Reply messages, not in Advertise. The appendix is declared informational, but the mismatch is concrete and could mislead implementers who use the table as a quick reference.
    - Evidence:  
      * Table 1 defines `INF_MAX_RT` with default `3600 secs` and describes it as a “Max Information-request timeout value”.  
      * Section 18.2.9 says: “The client MUST process any SOL_MAX_RT option (see Section 21.24) and INF_MAX_RT option (see Section 21.25) present in an Advertise message, even if the message contains a Status Code option …”.  
      * Section 21.25 says: “The DHCP server MAY include the INF_MAX_RT option in any response it sends to a client that has included the INF_MAX_RT option code in an Option Request option. The INF_MAX_RT option is a top-level option in the message to the client.”  
      * Appendix B, third table:  

        ```
                   SOL_MAX_RT  INF_MAX_RT
           Solicit
           Advert.    *
           ...
           Reply      *           *
        ```

        INF_MAX_RT is marked only for Reply, not Advert.
    - QuantitativeReasoning:  
      INF_MAX_RT is a top-level option that carries a 32‑bit timeout bound, with defaults in Table 1 and update rules in Sections 18.2.9 and 21.25. Section 18.2.9 is explicit that clients MUST process INF_MAX_RT when it appears in an Advertise. Since Advertise is a DHCPv6 message type and is explicitly named there, INF_MAX_RT is valid in Advertise. Appendix B’s matrix, however, indicates that INF_MAX_RT is only allowed in Reply messages (no “*” in the Advertise row under INF_MAX_RT), which directly contradicts that normative behavior.
    - Consequences:  
      Implementers who rely on Appendix B as a checklist may conclude that INF_MAX_RT is invalid or should be ignored in Advertise messages. A client might then silently ignore INF_MAX_RT in Advertise, undermining the server’s ability to tune the client’s Information‑request backoff early. Conversely, a server implementer might avoid sending INF_MAX_RT in Advertise because the table suggests it is not permitted. Although the appendix says the main text is authoritative, this inconsistency is specific and quantitative enough to cause real interoperability discrepancies.

  - Issue-2:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Relay-reply destination port vs RFC 8357 Relay Source Port Option
    - Description: Section 7.2 hardcodes UDP destination ports for server and relay transmissions, including a MUST that all Relay-reply messages be sent to UDP port 547, while RFC 8357 requires that, when the Relay Source Port Option is in use, the server and upstream relays send replies to the recorded source port of the downstream relay instead of the fixed 547. This document acknowledges RFC 8357 but does not narrow or qualify its own MUSTs, so the numeric rules are in direct tension.
    - Evidence:  
      * Section 7.2:

        - “Clients MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 546. Servers and relay agents MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 547.”  
        - “Therefore, clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547.”  
        - “Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546.”  
        - “Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 and client messages to UDP destination port 546.”  
        - “Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.”

      * RFC 8357 (excerpt given):

        - “… relax the fixed UDP source port requirement for the DHCP relay agents.”  
        - “This extension requires a DHCP server to remember the inbound packet's UDP port number along with the IPv4/IPv6 address. When sending back replies, the DHCP server MUST use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number.”  
        - “In the case of IPv6-cascaded relay agents…, the upstream relay agent needs to use the ‘Relay Source Port Option’ to record the downstream source port, and it MUST use this recorded port number instead of the fixed DHCP port number when replaying the reply messages.”
    - QuantitativeReasoning:  
      Section 7.2 states, without qualification, that:

      - All Relay-reply messages sent by a server MUST have UDP destination port 547.  
      - All Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages sent by a relay agent MUST have UDP destination port 547.

      RFC 8357, however, defines a mechanism whereby:

      - A relay agent may use a non‑547 UDP source port.  
      - The server MUST send its reply to that recorded port instead of the “fixed DHCP port number” (i.e., instead of 547).  
      - In cascaded relay scenarios, an upstream relay MUST send the Relay-reply to the downstream relay’s recorded source port, again potentially not 547.

      So for RFC 8357–enabled deployments, the required destination port for Relay-reply messages is “recorded relay source port P” (which can be any valid UDP port), not always 547. The blanket MUSTs in 7.2 and the MUSTs in RFC 8357 cannot both be universally true; only one holds when a Relay Source Port Option is present.
    - Consequences:  
      - A server or relay implementer who reads 7.2 literally but does not correctly incorporate RFC 8357 may always send Relay-reply messages to destination port 547, ignoring the recorded source port. This breaks the multi‑process relay scenarios RFC 8357 was designed for (different relay instances on the same IP address using different UDP ports), leading to replies delivered to the wrong process or dropped entirely.  
      - Conversely, an implementation that strictly follows RFC 8357 and sends Relay-reply messages to a non‑547 port could appear, on paper, to violate the fixed‑547 MUSTs in 7.2.  
      - The last sentence in 7.2 (“[RFC8357] changes some of these rules”) hints at the exception but does not quantitatively scope or restate the modified rule (e.g., “MUST send to 547 unless a Relay Source Port Option is present, in which case send to the recorded port”). This leaves an implementer reconciling two conflicting sets of numeric requirements solely by cross‑reading the external RFC, which is a real though subtle interoperability and conformance ambiguity.

DeonticAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 7 defines fixed “constants” for DHCPv6, including multicast addresses, UDP ports and their usage, status-code defaults, retransmission timers, and the representation of “infinity” for time values. The rest of the document then normatively relies on these constants for client, server, and relay behavior. The only serious normative tension in this excerpt is around the UDP port rules versus RFC 8357 generalized relay source ports.

- OverallDeonticRisk: Medium

- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Both
    - Title: Conflict / underspec between fixed Relay-reply destination port and RFC 8357 generalized source ports
    - Description:
      Section 7.2 states unconditional, strong requirements on server and relay UDP destination ports: “Servers and relay agents MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 547. Therefore, clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547. Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547 … Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547…” This creates a clear obligation that all Relay-reply traffic go to port 547 on the peer. By contrast, RFC 8357 explicitly relaxes the fixed-port model: when a relay uses a non-standard source UDP port, “the DHCP server MUST use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number” for replies, and in cascaded relay scenarios the Relay Source Port Option is used to propagate and honor that non-547 port.   As written, the combination of “Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547” with RFC 8357’s “MUST use the incoming relay’s source port instead of the fixed port” yields contradictory obligations whenever a relay legitimately uses a different port. The last sentence of 7.2 (“the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents”) acknowledges that there is an interaction, but it does not state normatively which specific MUSTs are overridden, or under what conditions. A strict implementer of this draft, who also implements RFC 8357, cannot tell from this document alone that the “MUST use 547” rule is conditional on *not* using the generalized port extension. The result is both (a) a formal inconsistency between this draft’s unconditional MUST and RFC 8357’s unconditional MUST for the same behavior, and (b) underspecification of the exception path (what exactly changes when the Relay Source Port Option is in use).
    - KeyTextSnippets:
      - “Servers and relay agents MUST listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 547. Therefore, clients MUST send DHCP messages to UDP destination port 547. Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547… Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547…” (Section 7.2)
      - “Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relays agents.” (Section 7.2)
      - “[RFC8357]… defines an extension to relax the fixed UDP source port requirement for the DHCP relay agents… When sending back replies, the DHCP server MUST use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number.”  
    - Impact:
      Without an explicit normative exception in 7.2 (or in the later server/relay behavior sections), different implementers may interpret the interaction with RFC 8357 differently. Some may follow 7.2 literally and always send Relay-reply to port 547, thereby breaking deployments that rely on generalized relay source ports and the Relay Source Port Option. Others may override 7.2 ad hoc based on their reading of RFC 8357. This risks interoperability failures in networks that deploy generalized relay port behavior, and makes it harder for implementers to determine the correct standards-conformant behavior. The minimal fix would be to qualify the “MUST send … to port 547” rules with an explicit exception such as: “unless RFC 8357 generalized source-port behavior is in use, in which case the server/relay MUST send to the UDP port indicated by the relay’s source port / Relay Source Port Option.”

CrossRFCReport:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 7 defines fixed UDP ports and their usage for DHCPv6 and then adds a brief note that the Relay Source Port Option from RFC 8357 “changes some of these rules”. Other parts of the draft and prior RFCs (RFC 3315 / 8415, RFC 8357) and the IANA registries define the baseline ports and the generalized source-port behavior for relays and servers.
- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: High
- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Both
    - ShortLabel: Ambiguous and conflicting UDP port rules vs RFC 8357
    - Description: Section 7.2 of the bis draft says unconditionally that “Servers MUST send Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547” and that “Relay agents MUST send Relay-forward and Relay-reply messages to UDP destination port 547”, while also stating that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC 8357] “changes some of these rules” without specifying exactly which rules are overridden or how. In contrast, RFC 8357 explicitly relaxes the fixed-port model: it allows relay agents to use a non‑547 UDP source port toward servers and requires servers to “use the UDP port number that the incoming relay agent uses instead of the fixed DHCP port number” when sending replies, and more concretely, “MUST check and use the UDP source port from the UDP packet of the Relay-forward message in replying to the relay agent”. RFC 8357 also requires upstream relays, when forwarding a Relay-reply that carries a Relay Source Port Option with a non-zero Downstream Source Port, to “use this UDP port number to forward the Relay-reply message to the downstream relay agent”, which may again be a non‑547 port. The base DHCPv6 spec RFC 8415 only required that servers and relays listen on 547, without any MUST on the destination port used for replies, so it did not directly conflict with RFC 8357’s generalized port behavior. By adding unconditional MUSTs on the destination ports while only vaguely noting that RFC 8357 “changes some of these rules”, the bis text produces a concrete normative contradiction for any implementation that follows both documents (one says “MUST use 547 as destination” and the other says “MUST use the relay’s source port instead of the fixed port”). It is also underspecified, because it never states the intended precedence or the precise exception (e.g., “except when RFC 8357 generalized source-port behavior is in use, in which case servers and relays MUST use the port indicated by the relay’s source port / Relay Source Port Option”). A strict implementer could reasonably read Section 7.2 as prohibiting the RFC 8357 behavior, leading to broken interoperability in deployments that rely on generalized relay source ports.

## Boundary Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BoundaryAnalysis:
- ExcerptUnderstanding: Section 7 defines the fixed “constants” that parameterize DHCPv6: multicast addresses, well-known UDP ports and their usage, the core message-type codepoints, general rules for status codes, a table of retransmission and timing parameters (including hop-count and various per-message IRT/MRT/MRC/MRD defaults), and the representation of time values including the special 0xffffffff “infinity” value. These constants are then referenced throughout the client/server/relay algorithms in Sections 14–21.
- OverallBoundaryBugLikelihood: None

- Findings:
  - Finding-1:
    - BugType: None
    - ShortLabel: No boundary/exceptional-case bugs detected in Section 7 constants
    - BoundaryAxis: 0xffffffff “infinity”, retransmission limit parameters (IRT/MRT/MRC/MRD), and HOP_COUNT_LIMIT / UDP port usage with RFC 8357
    - ExcerptEvidence:
      - Infinity: “All time values for lifetimes, T1, and T2 are unsigned 32-bit integers… The value 0xffffffff is taken to mean ‘infinity’ when used as a lifetime … or a value for T1 or T2… Care should be taken in setting T1 or T2 to 0xffffffff…” 
      - Use of infinity in IA options: IA_NA/IA_PD and IA Address/IA Prefix all explicitly refer back to this rule and reiterate that 0xffffffff means “infinity” and “should be used carefully”. 
      - Information Refresh Time explicitly defines 0xffffffff as infinity and overrides the default/ minimum values, while also allowing the client to cap the value. 
      - Retransmission parameters: Table 1 (SOL_TIMEOUT, SOL_MAX_RT, REQ_MAX_RC, CNF_MAX_RT, REN_MAX_RT, REB_MAX_RT, INF_MAX_RT, REL_MAX_RC, DEC_MAX_RC, REC_MAX_RC, HOP_COUNT_LIMIT=8, IRT_DEFAULT, IRT_MINIMUM, MAX_WAIT_TIME)  and the generic RT/IRT/MRT/MRC/MRD algorithm in Section 15 that defines behavior for all combinations, including MRC=0, MRD=0, and MRT=0. 
      - Hop count: HOP_COUNT_LIMIT=8 in Table 1, and relays MUST discard a Relay-forward whose hop-count is ≥ HOP_COUNT_LIMIT. 
      - UDP ports: “Clients MUST listen… on UDP port 546. Servers and relay agents MUST listen… on UDP port 547… clients MUST send… to destination port 547… It is RECOMMENDED… source port 546/547… MAY send … from any UDP source port… Please note that the Relay Source Port Option [RFC8357] changes some of these rules for servers and relay agents.” ; RFC 8357 then spells out precisely how relays and servers use non‑547 source ports and reply to those ports.  
    - Reasoning:
      - For 0xffffffff: the domain is clearly “all time values for lifetimes, T1, and T2” and every place that can legally contain such a value (IA Address, IA Prefix, IA_NA, IA_PD, and the Information Refresh Time option) gives explicit semantics for 0xffffffff as infinity and warns about its operational consequences, e.g., a client “will never attempt” Renew/Rebind when T1/T2==0xffffffff and will not spontaneously refresh configuration when information‑refresh‑time==0xffffffff unless some other trigger occurs.  This covers both normal and extreme cases (finite, 0, and infinity) without disagreement between sections.
      - T1/T2=0 cases are also explicitly handled: Section 14.2 explains that T1/T2 of 0 means “left to the discretion of the client” but the client MUST avoid storms, bunch renewals across IAs, and respect rate‑limiting; IA_NA/IA_PD text tells clients to treat non-zero T1/T2 as absolute times and defer to 14.2 when they are 0.  So both 0 and 0xffffffff are fully specified, with no gaps.
      - Retransmission constants: The RT algorithm in Section 15 defines behavior for all combinations of IRT, MRT, MRC, MRD, including corner cases where MRT=0 (no upper bound on RT), MRC=0 or MRD=0 (unbounded retries) and the special rule that if both MRC and MRD are zero the client “continues to transmit the message until it receives a response.”  Each message type then picks concrete parameter values from Table 1 that avoid unbounded growth in RT (either through MRT or small MRC), so there is no unaddressed overflow/wrap-around or undefined termination condition. For example, Solicit uses SOL_TIMEOUT, SOL_MAX_RT, MRC=0, MRD=0 but is explicitly allowed to continue indefinitely; Release/Decline have MRT=0 but a small finite MRC, bounding RT. 
      - HOP_COUNT_LIMIT: The field is a one‑octet hop-count that each relay increments; any Relay-forward with hop-count ≥ HOP_COUNT_LIMIT is discarded. With HOP_COUNT_LIMIT=8, that yields at most 8 relays (values 0–7 accepted, 8 dropped). The constant’s name (“Max hop count in a Relay-forward message”) and the discard rule are consistent—there’s no off‑by‑one ambiguity, and all boundary values (0, 7, 8, 255) have defined behavior. 
      - UDP ports and RFC 8357: Section 7.2’s dest-port rules are precise for the base protocol but then explicitly notes that RFC 8357 “changes some of these rules” for servers and relays.  RFC 8357 in turn redefines relay behavior when non‑547 source ports are used and requires servers to reply to the port indicated by the relay’s source port / Relay Source Port option, without changing the requirement that clients always send to dest port 547 and listen on 546.   Since 7.2 only constrains what implementations MUST support (they MUST listen on 546/547 and send to 546/547 in the base case) and does not forbid additional listening sockets or RFC‑8357 behavior, there is no normative contradiction, just a layered extension.
    - ImpactAssessment: Across these axes, every “weird but valid” case—T1/T2=0, T1/T2=0xffffffff, lifetimes=0xffffffff, extreme retransmission backoffs, maximum relay depth, and non‑standard relay UDP ports—is covered by explicit behavior in the base spec and, where applicable, in the referenced extension RFCs. Different interoperable implementations should converge on the same behavior for these boundaries, so there is no real inconsistency or underspecified exceptional case here.

- Notes:
  - Not a bug: The text in 7.2 about Relay-reply destination port 547 and the later note about RFC 8357 could look like a conflict if read in isolation, but because 7.2 immediately points to RFC 8357 and 8357 precisely redefines server/relay behavior only when the Relay Source Port option is present, the combined specification is coherent: base behavior is fixed ports, and generalized source ports are an explicit extension path.  
  - Not a bug: 7.7 mentions only lifetimes/T1/T2, but other time-valued options like Information Refresh Time explicitly define their own 0xffffffff semantics (and reference 7.7), so there is no gap for those additional 32‑bit “time” fields.
