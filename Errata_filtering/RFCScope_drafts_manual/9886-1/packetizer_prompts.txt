You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 1 of RFC 9886 introduces the role of DETs and registries in UAS Remote ID, explains that DETs/HHITs are mapped into DNS and managed by DIMEs (often realized by USSs), and states that the document’s scope is DNS registration of DETs under the 2001:30::/28 prefix and associated RRsets.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No procedures, timers, or state ordering are described here; it is purely architectural and scoping text.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Roles (UAS, DIME, USS, registries) are named but no normative send/receive responsibilities or flows are specified in this section.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope statement (DNS registration of DETs and reverse-domain delegation for 2001:30::/28) is clear and consistent with RFC 9374 and the later text; no apparent ambiguity or contradiction.
  - Causal: LOW - There are no executable algorithms or stepwise behaviors whose literal implementation could cause breakage; this section is descriptive.
  - Quantitative: LOW - The only numeric element is the IPv6 prefix 2001:30::/28, which matches RFC 9374 and its reverse domain; no size/range math or cardinality details appear here.
  - Deontic: LOW - Almost no RFC 2119 language is used in this section; there are no normative requirements to compare or reconcile.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF, YANG, CDDL, or field diagrams are present in Section 1 itself; structural formalisms appear only in later sections.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 9434 (figure reuse, USS/DIME relationship) and RFC 9374 (DETs/HHITs and prefix 2001:30::/28) are consistent with the quoted excerpts and standard DNS usage (STD13).
  - Terminology: LOW - Use of terms such as DET, HHIT hierarchy, DIME, USS, Public/Private Registry, and DNS matches the referenced architecture documents; no conflicting or dual names for the same concept are evident here.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behaviors, error conditions, or boundary values are discussed in this section.

Candidate Issues: 1

  Issue 1:
    Type: None
    Label: No plausible inconsistencies or underspecified behaviors detected in Section 1

    Sketch: Section 1 (Introduction, General Concept, Scope) is high-level and aligns with RFC 9374 and RFC 9434...
