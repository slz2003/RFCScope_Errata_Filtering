      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No procedures, timers, or state ordering are described here; it is purely architectural and scoping text."

      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Roles (UAS, DIME, USS, registries) are named but no normative send/receive responsibilities or flows are specified in this section."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The scope statement (DNS registration of DETs and reverse-domain delegation for 2001:30::/28) is clear and consistent with RFC 9374 and the later text; no apparent ambiguity or contradiction."

      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "There are no executable algorithms or stepwise behaviors whose literal implementation could cause breakage; this section is descriptive."

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The only numeric element is the IPv6 prefix 2001:30::/28, which matches RFC 9374 and its reverse domain; no size/range math or cardinality details appear here."

      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",

      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No ABNF, YANG, CDDL, or field diagrams are present in Section 1 itself; structural formalisms appear only in later sections."

      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to RFC 9434 (figure reuse, USS/DIME relationship) and RFC 9374 (DETs/HHITs and prefix 2001:30::/28) are consistent with the quoted excerpts and standard DNS usage (STD13)."

        "relevance": "LOW",

There are no internal contradictions, no mismatched numeric values, and no ambiguous normative requirements that would warrant errata work focused just on this section."
