    "excerpt_summary": "Section F gives an informal but partially normative overview of TLS 1.3’s intended security properties (handshake, record layer, 0‑RTT, PSKs, exporters, replay, etc.), relating them to the rest of the specification and to the research literature.",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Mostly high‑level security properties; no concrete state machines or event ordering that would introduce temporal contradictions beyond what is specified elsewhere."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Describes attacker versus endpoints at a conceptual level; no detailed sender/receiver rules that could invert roles."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The text clearly scopes properties to particular modes (PSK vs (EC)DHE, 0‑RTT vs 1‑RTT, external vs resumption PSK); no obvious scope bleed or mis‑scoping."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "It explains security consequences of design choices, but does not define new executable algorithms whose literal implementation would break other parts of the spec."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No new numeric limits or sizes are introduced here; it only references limits (e.g., Section 5.5) defined earlier."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "There are a few security‑considerations‑style MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT requirements (e.g., around 0‑RTT API behavior, combining external PSKs with certificates), but they are consistent with the main body and RFC 8446 practice."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No ABNF, YANG, or data structure definitions here beyond referencing earlier sections."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to external work (RFCs and papers) are for justification and context; they do not introduce protocol cross‑reference requirements where registry or section mismatches would arise."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Uses established terms from earlier sections (e.g., “external PSK”, “resumption PSK”, “binder”, “0‑RTT”, “forward secrecy”) without redefining them inconsistently."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Discusses edge cases (e.g., replay, post‑compromise, key erasure) at a conceptual level, but does not leave any critical boundary behavior undefined relative to the normative earlier sections."

        "sketch_for_experts": "Section F largely restates known security properties of TLS 1.3 and aligns with both the main body of the draft and RFC 8446. The additional normative statements (e.g., MUST NOT enable 0‑RTT without explicit application request; MUST NOT combine external PSKs with certificate‑based authentication absent another spec such as RFC 8773) are consistent with the earlier technical sections, not in tension with them. No internal contradictions, missing corner‑case behaviors, or cross‑RFC mismatches stand out that would warrant deeper expert investigation for errata."
