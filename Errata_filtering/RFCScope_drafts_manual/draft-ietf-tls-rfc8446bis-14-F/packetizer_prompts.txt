You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section F gives an informal but partially normative overview of TLS 1.3’s intended security properties (handshake, record layer, 0‑RTT, PSKs, exporters, replay, etc.), relating them to the rest of the specification and to the research literature.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Mostly high‑level security properties; no concrete state machines or event ordering that would introduce temporal contradictions beyond what is specified elsewhere.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Describes attacker versus endpoints at a conceptual level; no detailed sender/receiver rules that could invert roles.
  - Scope: LOW - The text clearly scopes properties to particular modes (PSK vs (EC)DHE, 0‑RTT vs 1‑RTT, external vs resumption PSK); no obvious scope bleed or mis‑scoping.
  - Causal: LOW - It explains security consequences of design choices, but does not define new executable algorithms whose literal implementation would break other parts of the spec.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No new numeric limits or sizes are introduced here; it only references limits (e.g., Section 5.5) defined earlier.
  - Deontic: LOW - There are a few security‑considerations‑style MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT requirements (e.g., around 0‑RTT API behavior, combining external PSKs with certificates), but they are consistent with the main body and RFC 8446 practice.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF, YANG, or data structure definitions here beyond referencing earlier sections.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to external work (RFCs and papers) are for justification and context; they do not introduce protocol cross‑reference requirements where registry or section mismatches would arise.
  - Terminology: LOW - Uses established terms from earlier sections (e.g., “external PSK”, “resumption PSK”, “binder”, “0‑RTT”, “forward secrecy”) without redefining them inconsistently.
  - Boundary: LOW - Discusses edge cases (e.g., replay, post‑compromise, key erasure) at a conceptual level, but does not leave any critical boundary behavior undefined relative to the normative earlier sections.
