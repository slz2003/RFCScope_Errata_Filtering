### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TemporalAnalysis:
  HighLevelSummary: Section 6 in rfc8446bis-14 defines the alert protocol and clarifies semantics for `close_notify`, `user_canceled`, and error alerts. The main ordering rules (when to send alerts, when the connection is considered closed, and how to process data before/after alerts) are largely coherent and consistent with the handshake and record-layer rules. The only subtle temporal concern is a small residual ambiguity about how strictly receivers must “ignore” `user_canceled` and when exactly they should treat the handshake as terminated versus the transport connection being closed.
  OverallTemporalRisk: Low
  CandidateIssues:
    - Id: T1
      Type: Underspecification
      ShortLabel: "user_canceled vs close_notify ordering and handshake termination"
      Description: |
        The bis text refines `user_canceled` into a closure-style alert that MUST be followed by `close_notify`, and it intends receivers to largely ignore it. However, the exact temporal effect of receiving `user_canceled` on the handshake state machine and connection closure is not spelled out as crisply as the introductory bullets in §1.2 suggest (“user_canceled should be ignored”). In particular, it is not fully explicit whether an implementation is allowed to treat `user_canceled` itself as terminating the TLS connection or the handshake, or whether it MUST wait for `close_notify` (or transport close) before treating the TLS connection as closed. This leaves some room for differing interpretations about when the handshake is “aborted” versus when the underlying TLS connection is considered closed, although in practice all reasonable interpretations still end up terminating the handshake and closing the connection soon thereafter.
      TemporalReasoning: |
        The relevant intended sequence for a “user canceled” handshake is:

          1. Handshake is in progress.
          2. One endpoint decides to cancel for non-protocol reasons.
          3. That endpoint sends an Alert record with description = user_canceled.
             • §6.1: “This alert notifies the recipient that the sender is canceling the handshake for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure.”
          4. The same endpoint then sends an Alert record with description = close_notify.
             • §6.1: “This alert MUST be followed by a ‘close_notify’.”
             • §5.1: “a record with an Alert type MUST contain exactly one message.” ⇒ user_canceled and close_notify are in separate records and occur in that order on the wire.
          5. On reception of `user_canceled`, the peer is instructed not to immediately treat this as end-of-data:
             • §6.1: “Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a ‘close_notify’ is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.”
          6. On reception of `close_notify`, the peer:
             • Must not expect further TLS records and must ignore any data received after the closure alert (§6.1: “Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored.”).
             • May close or partially close the transport; TLS-level connection is considered cleanly closed.

        This suggests a logical ordering:
          - `user_canceled` is a preface: “I am about to shut down this connection/handshake for user reasons.”
          - `close_notify` is the actual, protocol-level close signal.

        However, the specification never states in one place that:
          - Receiving `user_canceled` MUST NOT, by itself, be treated as connection closure; and
          - The only protocol event that closes the TLS connection in this flow is `close_notify` (or a transport-level close without a preceding error alert, contrary to best practice).

        Instead, it uses a weaker “SHOULD continue to read data” formulation for receivers of `user_canceled`. That leaves room for implementations that:
          - Upon receiving `user_canceled`, immediately decide to:
            • Treat the TLS connection as effectively dead, possibly send their own `close_notify` and/or error alert and close the transport right away, even before seeing the peer’s `close_notify`.

        This behavior is not obviously forbidden:
          - §6.1 says each party “MUST send a ‘close_notify’ alert before closing its write side … unless it has already sent some error alert.”
          - There is no explicit statement that `user_canceled` MUST NOT itself trigger closure semantics or handshake-abort semantics on receipt.
          - `user_canceled` is a closure alert and not in §6.2, so the “fatal error implies immediate close” rule for error alerts does not apply, but nothing prohibits a receiver from choosing to immediately send its own fatal alert and close.

        That creates a small temporal ambiguity:
          - One implementation might strictly “ignore” `user_canceled` in the sense of leaving its TLS connection state as-is until it sees `close_notify` or a transport close.
          - Another might treat `user_canceled` as “the peer is done, I will immediately tear down,” and not wait for the peer’s `close_notify`.

        Both end up terminating the handshake promptly, but the observable ordering (who sends which final alerts in which order, and whether both sides see each other’s `close_notify`) can differ.
      KeyEvidence:
        ExcerptPoints:
          - §1.2: “Clarify behavior around ‘user_canceled’, requiring that ‘close_notify’ be sent and that ‘user_canceled’ should be ignored.”
          - §6 (intro): “The ‘close_notify’ alert is used to indicate orderly closure of one direction of the connection.”
          - §6.1 (close_notify): “Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored. This alert MUST be sent with AlertLevel=warning.”
          - §6.1 (user_canceled): “This alert notifies the recipient that the sender is canceling the handshake for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure. … This alert MUST be followed by a ‘close_notify’. This alert generally has AlertLevel=warning. Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a ‘close_notify’ is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.”
          - §6.1 (general closure rule): “Each party MUST send a ‘close_notify’ alert before closing its write side of the connection, unless it has already sent some error alert.”
          - §5.1: “Alert messages … MUST NOT be fragmented across records, and multiple alert messages MUST NOT be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record. In other words, a record with an Alert type MUST contain exactly one message.”
        ContextPoints:
          - A.1/A.2 state machine appendices: alerts are not explicitly integrated into the handshake state diagrams; they are intended as out-of-band abort/closure signals.
      ImpactOnImplementations: |
        Different but plausible readings of `user_canceled` can lead to slightly different shutdown sequences:

        - Some stacks will:
          - Treat `user_canceled` as purely informational, keep the TLS state machine alive, and wait for `close_notify` before treating the TLS connection as closed.
        - Others may:
          - Immediately send their own `close_notify` or even a fatal alert and close the connection when they see `user_canceled`, rather than waiting for the peer’s `close_notify`.

        This does not usually break interoperability or security – in all cases the handshake ends and the connection is torn down – but it can lead to:
          - Inconsistent logging or error reporting (one side thinks there was a user cancellation, the other sees only a generic error).
          - Slightly different visibility of final alerts (one side might never see the peer’s `close_notify`).
          - Confusion for application designers who are trying to distinguish “non-protocol user abort” from protocol errors based solely on alert ordering.

        A short clarifying note such as “Receipt of `user_canceled` alone MUST NOT be treated as clean connection closure; the TLS connection is considered orderly-closed only upon receipt or sending of `close_notify` (or transport close)” would remove this ambiguity.

## Scope Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ScopeAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 6 defines the TLS 1.3 Alert protocol: the Alert structure, the classification of alerts into closure vs error, level handling, and the required behavior on sending/receiving each alert type, with updated semantics for `user_canceled` and the new `general_error` alert.
- ScopeModel:
  - Targets:
    - TLS 1.3 connections (and implementations) using the Alert content type.
    - Specific alert descriptions: `close_notify` and `user_canceled` as “closure alerts”; all alerts listed in Section 6.2 as “error alerts”.
    - Alert fields: `AlertLevel level` (legacy) and `AlertDescription description`.
  - Conditions:
    - In TLS 1.3, the severity is implicit in the alert type; the `level` field “can safely be ignored”.
    - All alerts listed in Section 6.2 MUST be sent with `AlertLevel=fatal` and treated as error alerts upon receipt, regardless of the level actually present.
    - Unknown alert descriptions MUST be treated as error alerts.
    - `close_notify` is used to indicate orderly closure of one direction; upon receiving it, the implementation SHOULD indicate end-of-data to the application and “any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored”.
    - `user_canceled` is a closure alert about canceling a handshake for non‑protocol reasons and MUST be followed by `close_notify`; receivers SHOULD continue reading data until they receive `close_notify`.
  - NotedAmbiguities:
    - The phrase “Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored” appears under the `close_notify` description but uses the class term “closure alert”, which by the earlier definition includes both `close_notify` and `user_canceled`, conflicting with the later guidance to keep reading after `user_canceled`.
    - The statement “Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts” is not explicitly scoped to TLS 1.3 connections, even though earlier-version behavior is defined in RFC 5246; implementers must infer that this rule is specific to TLS 1.3.

- CandidateIssues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Ambiguous scope of “closure alert” causes conflict between `close_notify` data-ignoring rule and `user_canceled` processing
    - ScopeProblemType: Over-broad class-level term (“closure alert”) where the rule appears intended only for `close_notify`
    - Evidence:
      - Alerts are classified: “Alerts are divided into two classes: closure alerts and error alerts.” Section 6.
      - `close_notify` description: “Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored. This alert MUST be sent with AlertLevel=warning.” Section 6.1.
      - `user_canceled` description: “This alert … MUST be followed by a ‘close_notify’. This alert generally has AlertLevel=warning. Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a ‘close_notify’ is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.” Section 6.1.
      - Change summary: “Clarify behavior around ‘user_canceled’, requiring that ‘close_notify’ be sent and that ‘user_canceled’ should be ignored.” Section 1.2.
    - DetailedReasoning:
      1. Section 6 introduces two alert classes, “closure alerts” and “error alerts”, without limiting “closure alerts” to a single type. `close_notify` and `user_canceled` are then both documented under “6.1. Closure Alerts”, so both are clearly members of the “closure alert” class.
      2. Under `close_notify`, the specification states: “Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored.” Because it says “a closure alert” (generic class term), a literal reading applies this to any closure alert, including `user_canceled`.
      3. The new text for `user_canceled` says: “This alert MUST be followed by a ‘close_notify’ … Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a ‘close_notify’ is received …”. This explicitly intends that `user_canceled` by itself does not terminate the connection’s read side; only `close_notify` does.
      4. The change log in Section 1.2 reinforces this intent by saying behavior around `user_canceled` has been clarified to require a subsequent `close_notify` and to have `user_canceled` “ignored” (i.e., not treated as connection-closing).
      5. If an implementer takes the “closure alert” rule at face value and treats any closure alert (including `user_canceled`) as defining the point after which “any data … MUST be ignored”, they will violate the new `user_canceled` guidance and prematurely stop processing peer data before `close_notify` arrives.
      6. Conversely, if the implementer follows the `user_canceled` rule and continues reading until `close_notify`, they are implicitly interpreting “closure alert” in the `close_notify` paragraph as if it meant only `close_notify`, not the entire class. This implicit narrowing is not spelled out.
      7. This creates a real normative inconsistency: one rule appears to apply to all closure alerts; another rule is clearly scoped only to `user_canceled` but effectively requires that the first rule not apply to `user_canceled`.
      8. The root cause is a scope mis-match: the “MUST ignore any data after a closure alert” rule is written at the class level (“closure alert”) but is intended to apply only after `close_notify`, the actual signal of orderly shutdown.
      9. If the text were implemented literally with class-wide scope, `user_canceled` would become a hard stop for further data, defeating the intended design (user cancellation signal + subsequent graceful close) and contradicting the updated requirements.
      10. A precise fix would be to re-scope the rule to `close_notify` explicitly, e.g. “Any data received after a close_notify alert has been received MUST be ignored”, or otherwise to state that `user_canceled` is not itself considered the “closure alert” referred to in that sentence.
      11. This is a pure scope issue: the term naming an entire class is used where only a specific instance (the `close_notify` alert) is meant, creating conflicting obligations for alert-handling behavior.

  - Issue-2:
    - BugType: None
    - ShortLabel: No clear scope bug in “unknown alerts are error alerts” versus earlier-version semantics
    - ScopeProblemType: None
    - Evidence:
      - Section 6 states: “All the alerts listed in Section 6.2 MUST be sent with AlertLevel=fatal and MUST be treated as error alerts when received … Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts.”
      - Section 1.4 limits changes that affect TLS 1.2 to a specific enumerated set and says: “Additionally, this document clarifies some compliance requirements for earlier versions of TLS; see Section 9.3.”
      - Section 9.3’s “Protocol Invariants” clarifications for earlier versions concern extension and parameter handling, not alert semantics.
      - The document reproduces RFC 5246 text for alert handling separately, indicating that TLS 1.2 behavior is still governed by RFC 5246 unless explicitly updated.
    - DetailedReasoning:
      1. The sentence “Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts” is syntactically unqualified, but it appears in a section that otherwise describes TLS 1.3 semantics and directly precedes a list of TLS 1.3 error alerts.
      2. The only place where the document explicitly extends requirements into earlier TLS versions is Section 9.3; that section does not mention alerts, so there is no clear intent to retrofit TLS 1.2 alert semantics.
      3. RFC 5246’s own Section 7.2 defines different rules for alert levels and unknown alerts; that older behavior is reproduced later in this draft, which further suggests that TLS 1.2 alert handling remains governed by RFC 5246 unless explicitly updated.
      4. In the absence of an explicit statement that this document updates RFC 5246’s alert processing rules, the natural reading for experienced implementers is that the “unknown alerts are error alerts” rule applies to TLS 1.3 connections, not to earlier protocol versions.
      5. While the scoping could be made more explicit (e.g., by saying “In TLS 1.3, unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts”), current wording is unlikely to cause real-world mis-implementation by readers familiar with the version-structured nature of the TLS specs.
      6. Therefore, this does not rise to the level of a clear, implementer-impacting scope bug; at most it is an editorial opportunity for clarification, not an errata-grade defect.

- ResidualUncertainties:
  - The behavior of TLS 1.3 endpoints that receive a numerically known but `_RESERVED` alert description (e.g., a legacy code used only in TLS 1.2) in an otherwise TLS 1.3 connection is not explicitly specified. Practically, such alerts would be treated as generic fatal error conditions, but the spec does not state this directly; the omission is minor given that peers are forbidden from sending those codes in TLS 1.3 and such cases indicate a non-compliant or malicious peer.

## Causal Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Summary**

Following Section 6 of this draft literally yields a coherent, implementable alert and closure model. The special handling of `user_canceled` remains consistent with the general “closure vs error” split, and the new `general_error` alert also fits cleanly into the error-alert rules. There is no fundamental interoperability or security breakage if the text is implemented as written.

---

2. **Causal Analysis**

### 2.1. Global alert semantics

Section 6 defines two classes of alerts:

- **Closure alerts** (Section 6.1):  
  These do *orderly* shutdown. Specifically:
  - `close_notify`  
  - `user_canceled`
- **Error alerts** (Section 6.2):  
  All alerts listed in 6.2 **and any unknown alert type** are “error alerts” and:
  - MUST be sent with `AlertLevel = fatal`, and  
  - “MUST be treated as error alerts when received regardless of the AlertLevel in the message.”  

It also states:

- For **error alerts**:  
  “Upon receiving an error alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate an error to the application and MUST NOT allow any further data to be sent or received on the connection.”
- For **`close_notify`**:  
  - “The 'close_notify' alert is used to indicate orderly closure of one direction of the connection.”
  - “Upon receiving such an alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate end-of-data to the application.”
  - “Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored.”

So causally:

- Error alerts cause **immediate abort** and no further traffic.
- Closure alerts cause **graceful half-close**, followed by ignoring any further data beyond the closure point.

### 2.2. Behavior of `user_canceled`

Section 6.1 defines `user_canceled`:

- Purpose:  
  “This alert notifies the recipient that the sender is canceling the handshake for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure. If a user cancels an operation after the handshake is complete, just closing the connection by sending a 'close_notify' is more appropriate.”
- Sending requirement:  
  “This alert MUST be followed by a 'close_notify'.”
- Level:  
  “This alert generally has AlertLevel=warning.” (i.e., level is legacy, type is what matters.)
- Receiving behavior:  
  “Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a 'close_notify' is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.”

Causally, if both sides obey this:

1. **Sender** who aborts for non-protocol reasons:
   - Sends `Alert{warning, user_canceled}` (or any level; receivers ignore the level).
   - Then *must* send a `close_notify`.
   - After sending `close_notify`, it can close its write side per the general closure rules.

2. **Receiver**:
   - On `user_canceled`, it:
     - Does *not* treat this as an error alert (because it is not in 6.2).
     - Does *not* close immediately.
     - Continues reading until it receives the `close_notify`.
   - On `close_notify`:
     - It indicates end-of-data to the application.
     - It MUST ignore any data after that alert.

So the *effective* behavior is: `user_canceled` is an informational precursor, but the actual closure semantics still hinge on `close_notify`. This matches the change note in §1.2 (“requiring that 'close_notify' be sent and that 'user_canceled' should be ignored”) in the sense that:

- The protocol’s *state changes* are driven by `close_notify`,  
- `user_canceled` may be logged, but does not alter the state machine beyond the fact that a `close_notify` is imminent.

### 2.3. Interaction with generic closure rules

The generic closure rules in 6.1 say:

- “Either party MAY initiate a close of its write side of the connection by sending a 'close_notify' alert.”
- “Each party MUST send a 'close_notify' alert before closing its write side of the connection, unless it has already sent some error alert.”

Since `user_canceled` is *not* an error alert (it’s not listed in 6.2), the exception “unless it has already sent some error alert” does not apply. Thus:

- A sender that uses `user_canceled` is still obligated to send `close_notify`.
- That obligation is reinforced explicitly: “This alert MUST be followed by a 'close_notify'.”

So there is **no conflict** between the generic closure rules and the specific `user_canceled` rules; they agree that:

- `user_canceled` alone is not a valid final close, and  
- `close_notify` is always required for an orderly close when no fatal error has been sent.

### 2.4. What if peers misbehave?

If an endpoint follows the spec literally, it never:

- Sends application or further handshake data between `user_canceled` and `close_notify`, because it is “canceling the handshake”.
- Omits the `close_notify` after `user_canceled` (since that’s a MUST).
- Treats `user_canceled` as a fatal error; instead, it waits for `close_notify`.

If a peer violates these rules (e.g., sends `user_canceled` without `close_notify`, or continues the handshake), the receiving implementation can still behave safely using existing generic rules:

- It will never treat `user_canceled` as success; the handshake will not complete, because no valid Finished exchange occurs.
- Any further handshake message that arrives after an alert is unexpected according to the handshake sequencing in §4.4.1 and Appendix A; such a peer is simply non-compliant.
- A transport-level close without `close_notify` is already treated as potentially truncated; this is not introduced by `user_canceled`.

These are misbehaving-peer cases, not internal inconsistencies of the spec.

### 2.5. `general_error` and the error-alert rules

The new `general_error` alert (code 117) is placed explicitly in the 6.2 list:

- “general_error: Sent to indicate an error condition in cases when either no more specific error is available or the sender wishes to conceal the specific error code. Implementations SHOULD use more specific errors when available.”

Because it is in §6.2:

- It MUST be sent as `AlertLevel=fatal`.
- On receipt, it MUST be treated as an error alert regardless of the `level`.
- The receiver then MUST “close the connection without sending or receiving any additional data.”

This is consistent with the general error-alert semantics and with the guidance elsewhere to use `decode_error` / `illegal_parameter` for parsing and semantic problems. It does not create any unexecutable behavior: it’s simply a generic fatal error code.

---

3. **Problem Classification**

For the specific hypothesis:

> “Semantics and treatment of `user_canceled` vs generic ‘closure alert’ rules”

- There is **no causal inconsistency**: one can implement exactly what the text says, and the resulting alert and closure behavior is well-defined and interoperable.
- There is also no **causal underspecification** that affects correctness:
  - The sender’s obligations (`MUST` follow with `close_notify`) are clear.
  - The receiver’s obligations (`SHOULD` continue reading until `close_notify` and treat `user_canceled` as informational) are clear.
  - The existing handshake state machine and close rules cover the rest.

The text could be *more explicit* that `user_canceled` MUST NOT be surfaced as a distinct application-level error and MUST NOT change the connection’s state apart from logging, but this is a clarity issue, not a mechanical or security bug.

---

4. **Minimal Fix Shape (Optional)**

If the WG wanted to make the intended behavior even crisper without changing wire behavior, a minimal clarification could be:

- In §6.1 under `user_canceled`, add:
  - “Receiving implementations **MUST NOT** treat this alert as an error and **MUST NOT** change the application-visible state of the connection, other than optionally logging its occurrence; only the subsequent `close_notify` alert determines closure semantics.”

This would align the body text explicitly with the intent summarized earlier in §1.2.

---

5. **Non-Issues**

- The fact that `user_canceled` is a closure alert and not part of the universally-fatal 6.2 set is intentional and does not break anything.
- The requirement that all 6.2 alerts (including `general_error`) be treated as fatal, regardless of the `AlertLevel` field, is consistent with the statement that “in TLS 1.3, the severity is implicit in the type of alert being sent, and the level field can safely be ignored.”
- The possibility of peers misusing `user_canceled` (e.g., not sending `close_notify`) represents non-compliance by those peers, not a flaw in the specified behavior for compliant implementations.

It also adds a new `general_error` alert and tightens some behaviors (e.g., `user_canceled` and `close_notify`) relative to RFC 8446.

- OverallDeonticRisk: Medium

- Issues:

  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - Title: `general_error` vs. “MUST send X alert” requirements
    - Description:  
      Section 6.2 gives a global rule: “when the phrases ‘terminate the connection with an X alert’ and ‘abort the handshake with an X alert’ mean that the implementation MUST send alert X if it sends any alert.” It is then used throughout the spec (including in Section 6’s note about parse/semantic errors) to require specific alerts such as `decode_error` or `illegal_parameter`: e.g., “Peers which receive a message which cannot be parsed … MUST terminate the connection with a `decode_error` alert” and “Peers which receive a message which is syntactically correct but semantically invalid … MUST terminate the connection with an `illegal_parameter` alert.” In the same section, the new `general_error` alert is defined as “Sent to indicate an error condition in cases when either no more specific error is available or the sender wishes to conceal the specific error code. Implementations SHOULD use more specific errors when available.” This text strongly implies that it is acceptable to send `general_error` instead of the more specific alert (e.g., to conceal whether the error was a `decode_error`, `illegal_parameter`, etc.). However, for every place where the spec says “terminate/abort with X alert”, Section 6.2 explicitly states that the sender MUST send X if it sends any alert, leaving no latitude to substitute `general_error`. The two requirements conflict: one invites using `general_error` to conceal specific codes; the other forbids deviating from the mandated code in any context where the spec names one. The likely intent is that `general_error` is only permissible when the specification does not already require a specific alert code, but that scope is not stated.
    - KeyTextSnippets:
      - “Whenever an implementation encounters a fatal error condition, it SHOULD send an appropriate fatal alert and MUST close the connection … The phrases ‘terminate the connection with an X alert’ and ‘abort the handshake with an X alert’ mean that the implementation MUST send alert X if it sends any alert.” (Section 6.2)
      - “Peers which receive a message which cannot be parsed according to the syntax … MUST terminate the connection with a `decode_error` alert. Peers which receive a message which is syntactically correct but semantically invalid … MUST terminate the connection with an `illegal_parameter` alert.” (Section 6)
      - “general_error: Sent to indicate an error condition in cases when either no more specific error is available or the senders wishes to conceal the specific error code. Implementations SHOULD use more specific errors when available.” (Section 6.2)
    - Impact:  
      Implementers reading the `general_error` text can reasonably conclude that they are allowed to replace specific alerts (including ones mandated with “MUST terminate … with X alert”) with `general_error` to avoid leaking information, while the earlier rule forbids that. Different stacks may therefore diverge: some always send specific alerts where mandated, others send `general_error` instead. That affects interoperability expectations (e.g., what error peers see on parse/semantic failures) and undermines the stated security goal of using particular alerts in particular failure modes. The minimal repair is to constrain `general_error` explicitly, e.g., “only where this specification or an applicable application profile does not require a more specific alert code.”

  - Issue-2:
    - BugType: None
    - Title: Treatment of `user_canceled`, unknown, and RESERVED alerts across versions
    - Description:  
      The router flagged possible problems around (a) `user_canceled` semantics and (b) handling unknown/RESERVED alert codes in mixed-version deployments. In this draft, `user_canceled` is clearly classified as a closure alert in Section 6.1, with tightened requirements: “This alert MUST be followed by a `close_notify`”, and “Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a `close_notify` is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.” This is consistent with the general rules in Section 6: the “error alert” rules (MUST NOT allow further data, MUST forget keys) apply only to Section 6.2 error alerts, and `user_canceled` is not in Section 6.2. The strengthened “MUST be followed by a `close_notify`” simply aligns with the global rule that each side MUST send `close_notify` before closing its write side (unless an error alert was already sent), so there is no internal contradiction.  
      For unknown and RESERVED alerts: Section 6 says “All the alerts listed in Section 6.2 MUST be sent with AlertLevel=fatal and MUST be treated as error alerts when received … Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts.” Section 6.2 further clarifies that “[a]ll alerts defined below in this section, as well as all unknown alerts, are universally considered fatal as of TLS 1.3”, explicitly scoping that policy to TLS 1.3. Appendix B.2 lists many *_RESERVED* alerts that existed in earlier TLS versions and notes that TLS 1.3 implementations MUST NOT send them but might receive them from older TLS implementations. This is not self-contradictory: in a TLS 1.3 connection, receipt of such a code is effectively “unknown” and must be treated as a fatal error; in a TLS 1.2 connection, RFC 5246’s Section 7.2 alert semantics continue to apply. Section 1.4 and 9.3 identify which parts of this document “optionally affect implementations of TLS 1.2”; Section 6 is not listed as changing TLS 1.2’s alert rules. Thus there is no deontic inconsistency; the text could perhaps be clearer about scoping in an informational sense, but it does not impose conflicting normative requirements.
    - KeyTextSnippets:
      - “user_canceled: … This alert MUST be followed by a `close_notify`. This alert generally has AlertLevel=warning. Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a `close_notify` is received…” (Section 6.1)
      - “Error alerts indicate abortive closure of the connection (see Section 6.2). Upon receiving an error alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate an error to the application and MUST NOT allow any further data to be sent or received on the connection.” (Section 6)
      - “All the alerts listed in Section 6.2 MUST be sent with AlertLevel=fatal and MUST be treated as error alerts when received regardless of the AlertLevel in the message. Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts.” (Section 6)
      - “All alerts defined below in this section, as well as all unknown alerts, are universally considered fatal as of TLS 1.3 (see Section 6).” (Section 6.2)
      - “TLS 1.3 implementations MUST NOT send them but might receive them from older TLS implementations.” (B.2, re *_RESERVED* alerts – wording summarized from this appendix)
    - Impact:  
      None from a normative standpoint. The alert-level and error/closure classifications are coherent for TLS 1.3, and the interaction with TLS 1.2 and earlier is governed by RFC 5246’s alert semantics plus the explicit statement that the “universally considered fatal” rule is “as of TLS 1.3”. Implementations can unambiguously implement the required behavior; any remaining concerns are primarily editorial clarity rather than deontic bugs.

### Expert Analysis:

CrossRFCReport:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 6 of rfc8446bis-14 defines the TLS 1.3 alert protocol: the Alert structure, the classification into closure vs error alerts, the requirement that all Section 6.2 alerts and unknown alerts be treated as fatal in TLS 1.3, the special handling of `close_notify` and `user_canceled`, and the addition of the new `general_error(117)` alert and its IANA registration.
- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Low
- Issues: []
- IfNoIssues:
  - Comment:  
    Cross-checking the draft’s Section 6 against RFC 8446, RFC 5246, RFC 7507, RFC 6066, RFC 7301, and the IANA TLS Alerts registry does not reveal substantive cross-document inconsistencies.

    1. **Scope of “fatal” alerts and unknown alerts**  
       - rfc8446 already stated that all Section 6.2 alerts “MUST be sent with AlertLevel=fatal” and that unknown alerts are treated as error alerts. The bis draft repeats this and Section 6.2 explicitly scopes the “universally considered fatal” rule to “as of TLS 1.3”. This is a change for TLS 1.3 only and does not purport to retroactively redefine TLS 1.2 semantics in RFC 5246, which still governs TLS 1.2 handshakes.  
       - The TLS Alerts registry is version-agnostic, but rfc8446bis’s rule is clearly about *behavior in TLS 1.3 connections*. There is no mismatch with RFC 5246’s looser rules for alert levels in TLS 1.2: 1.2 endpoints following RFC 5246 can continue to treat some alerts as warnings, and 1.3 endpoints must treat Section 6.2 and unknown alerts as fatal in 1.3 handshakes.

    2. **Reserved alert codes versus older versions**  
       - Appendix B.2 in the draft keeps all IANA-assigned alert codepoints, marking many legacy ones as `*_RESERVED` (e.g., `decryption_failed_RESERVED(21)`, `no_renegotiation_RESERVED(100)`). This matches RFC 8446’s treatment: these codes are “used in previous versions of TLS and MUST NOT be sent” by TLS 1.3, but might be received from older implementations. That is consistent with the global TLS Alerts registry.  
       - Section 6.2’s “all alerts defined below” list *does not include* the `*_RESERVED` codes; it only lists the active alerts for TLS 1.3. Thus, the blanket “fatal as of TLS 1.3” rule applies to the 6.2 set, not to reserved codes. When TLS 1.3-capable endpoints negotiate TLS 1.2, RFC 5246’s semantics for those codes still apply; rfc8446bis does not override them except where it explicitly updates TLS 1.2 (Section 1.4), which does not include alert semantics. That leaves no hard conflict, only that the draft is intentionally tightening behavior for TLS 1.3.

    3. **`user_canceled` and closure semantics**  
       - RFC 5246 defines `user_canceled` as an error alert “generally” at warning level and says it “should be followed by a close_notify”. RFC 8446 already moved `user_canceled` into the closure discussion but kept essentially the same semantics.  
       - rfc8446bis refines this for TLS 1.3:  
         * `close_notify` is explicitly “MUST be sent with AlertLevel=warning”.  
         * `user_canceled` “MUST be followed by a close_notify” and receivers “SHOULD continue to read data … until a close_notify is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.”  
       - This is a clarification and tightening of TLS 1.3 behavior, not a cross-RFC contradiction. TLS 1.2 behavior remains governed by RFC 5246; the bis document does not require reinterpreting TLS 1.2 `user_canceled`.

    4. **New `general_error(117)` alert and registry alignment**  
       - In RFC 8446, alert code 117 was unassigned; in this draft, Section 6.2 defines `general_error(117)` and Section 11 explicitly instructs IANA to add that entry to the “TLS Alerts” registry. This uses a previously unallocated codepoint and the correct registry name. It does not collide with any value in RFC 5246, RFC 8446, or other referenced specs.  
       - The description (“use when no more specific error is available or when concealing the specific code”) is semantically compatible with existing alert usage and does not override or conflict with any other RFC-defined alert.

    5. **Cross-RFC references for specific alerts**  
       - `inappropriate_fallback(86)` refers to RFC 7507, with the same semantics (server-only, fatal if a downgrade retry is detected).  
       - `unrecognized_name(112)` and `bad_certificate_status_response(113)` follow RFC 6066’s definitions.  
       - `no_application_protocol(120)` matches RFC 7301’s definition exactly (fatal server alert when the client’s ALPN list has no acceptable protocol).  
       These mappings are all consistent with the defining RFCs.

    In light of the above, the router’s suggested concerns about `user_canceled` and unknown/RESERVED alerts represent design/clarification choices within TLS 1.3 rather than cross-RFC or registry mismatches. A careful implementer who distinguishes TLS 1.3 from earlier versions and follows the IANA registries will not be led to an inconsistent or non-interoperable implementation by the text in Section 6 of this draft.

## Boundary Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BoundaryAnalysis:
- ExcerptUnderstanding:  
  Section 6 defines the TLS 1.3 Alert protocol: the Alert structure, the AlertDescription enum, the division into closure vs error alerts, and required behavior when sending or receiving alerts. In TLS 1.3, severity is no longer taken from the level field; instead the description value (and its section, 6.1 vs 6.2) determines whether the alert is a closure or an error, and all 6.2 alerts and unknown codes are fatal. The section also tightens behavior for `close_notify` and `user_canceled`, and adds a new generic `general_error` alert.

- OverallBoundaryBugLikelihood: Low

- Findings:

  - Finding-1:
    - BugType: None
    - ShortLabel: `user_canceled` behavior at handshake vs post‑handshake
    - BoundaryAxis: Alert classification and behavior for `user_canceled` in different phases and levels
    - ExcerptEvidence:  
      - “In TLS 1.3, the severity is implicit in the type of alert being sent, and the ‘level’ field can safely be ignored.” (Section 6)  
      - “user_canceled: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender is canceling the handshake for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure. If a user cancels an operation after the handshake is complete, just closing the connection by sending a ‘close_notify’ is more appropriate. This alert MUST be followed by a ‘close_notify’. This alert generally has AlertLevel=warning. Receiving implementations SHOULD continue to read data from the peer until a ‘close_notify’ is received, though they MAY log or otherwise record them.” (Section 6.1)
    - Reasoning:  
      The domain here is the alert description `user_canceled` and its use in two boundary cases: (a) during the handshake and (b) after the handshake has completed. The text classifies `user_canceled` as a closure alert (Section 6.1, not 6.2), and explicitly says it “MUST be followed by a ‘close_notify’,” eliminating ambiguity about whether it alone suffices to close the connection. Because TLS 1.3 says the alert level is ignored and severity is implicit in the type, mis-set levels (e.g., a peer sending `user_canceled` with `fatal`) do not change semantics; it remains a closure alert and does not become an “error alert” that terminates the connection under the 6.2 rules.  
      On receipt, the only normative action mandated is to “SHOULD continue to read data … until a ‘close_notify’ is received”, which is a recommendation to effectively ignore `user_canceled` for protocol semantics and treat `close_notify` as the true closure signal. Implementations MAY close sooner (SHOULD, not MUST), but in that case they simply cause an earlier termination of a handshake that the peer has already decided to cancel; they do not invalidate any otherwise-successful session. After the handshake has completed, the text further advises that sending just `close_notify` is “more appropriate”, so `user_canceled` use after completion is discouraged but still has well-defined closure semantics. There is thus no point at which a conformant peer is left unsure how to classify or react to `user_canceled`.
    - ImpactAssessment:  
      Different implementations might choose to immediately tear down the transport upon `user_canceled` rather than waiting for `close_notify`, but the peer has already indicated it is canceling the handshake, so there is no successful-connection path that depends on treating `user_canceled` in a more nuanced way. This is a robustness/usability variation, not a boundary-specification bug.

  - Finding-2:
    - BugType: None
    - ShortLabel: Handling of unknown vs RESERVED alert codes and older-version peers
    - BoundaryAxis: Unknown alert codes; codes reserved for prior TLS versions; mixed-version deployments
    - ExcerptEvidence:  
      - “All the alerts listed in Section 6.2 MUST be sent with AlertLevel=fatal and MUST be treated as error alerts when received regardless of the AlertLevel in the message. Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts.” (Section 6)  
      - “All alerts defined below in this section, as well as all unknown alerts, are universally considered fatal as of TLS 1.3 (see Section 6.2).” (Section 6.2, paraphrased from the provided text pattern)  
      - “Values listed as ‘_RESERVED’ were used in previous versions of TLS and are listed here for completeness. TLS 1.3 implementations MUST NOT send them but might receive them from older TLS implementations.” (Appendix B.2 preamble)  
      - The 1.2 text (RFC 5246 excerpt) defines additional alerts and reserves some codes; TLS 1.3 text explicitly states it is backward compatible and that this document “defines several changes that optionally affect implementations of TLS 1.2” but continues to rely on RFC 5246 semantics when TLS 1.2 is actually negotiated (Sections 1.4, E).
    - Reasoning:  
      The main boundary concerns are: (a) how TLS 1.3 endpoints should treat truly unknown alert codes, and (b) how they should treat codes that are syntactically “known but RESERVED” for older versions (e.g., `decryption_failed_RESERVED(21)`, `no_renegotiation_RESERVED(100)`), especially when interoperating with TLS 1.2. For TLS 1.3 connections, Section 6 is clear: all alerts defined in 6.2 and any unknown codes are fatal, independent of the level field. Closure alerts (`close_notify`, `user_canceled`) are the only non-error class and are explicitly listed in 6.1, not 6.2, so there is no overlap.  
      For RESERVED codes, this document does not classify them as valid alerts in TLS 1.3 (they are not listed in Section 6.2), and explicitly says “MUST NOT send them” in TLS 1.3; i.e., they are not part of the valid TLS 1.3 alert space. The only place they can legitimately appear is when TLS 1.2 (or earlier) has been negotiated; in that case, RFC 5246’s alert semantics apply, and this document does not try to retroactively redefine them. The phrase “might receive them from older TLS implementations” in B.2 is consistent with this: it warns 1.3-capable stacks that if they also implement TLS 1.2, they can still see those codes in TLS 1.2 connections, not in a TLS 1.3 connection.  
      The potentially confusing “Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts” is also scoped by the surrounding language “as of TLS 1.3” and the fact that Section 6.2 repeats that this applies “as of TLS 1.3”. For TLS 1.2 negotiation, the text explicitly defers to RFC 5246, which has its own alert-handling rules. Thus, there is no normative conflict: in a TLS 1.3 connection, unknown codes are fatal; in a TLS 1.2 connection, 5246’s behavior governs and the “_RESERVED” names in B.2 are simply documenting the shared codepoint space.
    - ImpactAssessment:  
      Implementations that strictly follow the version negotiated on the connection will not face ambiguity: in TLS 1.3, unknown alerts are uniformly fatal and RESERVED ones are not valid to send; in TLS 1.2, the pre‑existing RFC 5246 rules apply. While the presence of RESERVED names in Appendix B.2 alongside the TLS 1.3 text could be misread if taken out of context, the protocol behavior at version and codepoint boundaries is sufficiently determined that interoperable behavior is not at risk.

- Notes:
  - Not a bug: The new `general_error` alert is clearly placed in Section 6.2, so it is unambiguously a fatal error alert like the others there. Because the spec continues to prescribe `decode_error` and `illegal_parameter` for syntactic and semantic parse failures, `general_error` is reserved for higher-level or intentionally obfuscated error conditions, and there is no gap where a receiver would be unsure how to classify it.
