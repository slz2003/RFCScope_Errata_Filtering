You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 3 normatively specifies AccECN: how TCP negotiates AccECN during the 3‑way handshake, how the ACE field and AccECN options encode ECN feedback, and behavioral requirements for hosts, proxies, and middleboxes.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Handshake and retransmission sequencing is complex but internally consistent, with careful treatment of multiple SYN/SYN‑ACKs and TIME‑WAIT.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Client/server and Data Sender/Receiver roles are clearly separated; who sets vs. reflects ECN is consistently described.
  - Scope: LOW - Rules are clearly scoped per half‑connection, per direction, and per mode (AccECN/Classic/Not‑ECN); distinctions for SYN/SYN‑ACK vs data are explicit.
  - Causal: LOW - Counter initialization, ACE/option encoding, and zeroing/mangling fallbacks form coherent cause→effect chains that remain implementable.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Counter widths (3‑bit ACE, 24‑bit option fields) and initial values (r.cep=5, r.e0b=r.e1b=1) are used consistently across tables and algorithms.
  - Deontic: LOW - Normative requirements (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) about negotiation, mode changes, ECT use, and feedback behavior are internally aligned and explicitly update RFC 3168 where needed.
  - Structural: LOW - The use of tables (e.g., Table 2–5) and figures (ACE layout, options) matches the prose; no ABNF/YANG‑style formalism conflicts are evident.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 3168, 8311, 3540, 9293, 2018, 2883, etc. appear correct and consistent with how those RFCs define ECN, TCP flags, SACK/D‑SACK, and initialization.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terms like ACE, AE/CWR/ECE flags, AccECN Options, “Acceptable” packet, and AccECN mode are used consistently once introduced.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge cases (SYN cookies, zero windows, ACK loss, ACK filtering, middlebox mangling, option stripping, stateless handshakes) are explicitly discussed with defined behavior.
