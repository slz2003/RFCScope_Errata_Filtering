  "routing_summary": {
    "excerpt_summary": "Appendix A gives informal client and server state-machine diagrams that summarize legal TLS 1.3 handshake transitions, including PSK, 0‑RTT, and certificate-based paths.",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The appendix is a non-normative summary; message ordering and key transitions appear consistent with the detailed rules in Section 4."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Client/server roles and directions in the diagrams match the main handshake description; no role inversions are apparent."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The appendix is explicitly scoped to “handshakes” and does not attempt to cover post‑handshake messages; that matches the surrounding text."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No obvious causal contradictions (e.g., use of keys before derivation, use of messages before negotiation) are visible relative to Sections 2, 4, 5, and 7."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The state diagrams do not introduce sizes, counters, or numeric limits; those remain in the main text."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Appendix A does not introduce new MUST/SHOULD-level requirements; it just illustrates flows already normatively specified elsewhere."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The diagrams are informal, not formal syntax; there is no separate ABNF/struct misalignment to check here."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Appendix A does not introduce or rely on new external RFC references beyond what is already used and specified normatively earlier."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "State names and key labels (K_send, K_recv, “early data”, “handshake”, “application”) are consistent with the terminology in Sections 2, 4, 5, and 7."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Edge cases (e.g., 0‑RTT rejection, HelloRetryRequest loops, absence of client auth) are broadly represented in the diagrams and do not contradict the detailed boundary handling specified elsewhere."
