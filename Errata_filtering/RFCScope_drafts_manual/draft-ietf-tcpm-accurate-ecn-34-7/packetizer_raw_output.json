The two AccECN option kinds (172 and 174) are used consistently throughout (figures, normative text, and IANA table), and their variable-length nature (with specific allowed lengths defined earlier) is compatible with using “N” in the registry. The instructions to IANA about updating registry references and notes are procedural/administrative rather than wire-format- or grammar‑affecting. They do not introduce ambiguity about bit positions, field sizes, option formats, or encodings, and therefore do not constitute structural or syntactic bugs from an implementability standpoint."
