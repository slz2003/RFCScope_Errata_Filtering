RFC 8311’s Section 7 already caused IANA to mark bit 7 as Reserved with an annotation about RFC3540. Experts should check:\n      * Whether this document is expected to formally list “Updates: 8311” (in addition to 3168) when it changes the status of a bit that 8311 previously made Reserved.\n      * Whether asking IANA to replace the primary reference to RFC8311 entirely (rather than having both this RFC and RFC8311 as references plus an annotation) is consistent with current IANA practice for TCP Header Flags.\n      * If any ambiguity could arise in the registry about the historical vs current meaning of bit 7 (NS vs AE), and whether the present wording is sufficient to avoid misinterpretation by implementers or IANA.\n      This is likely a minor editorial/administrative point, but it is the only place where cross-RFC/registry consistency might need explicit confirmation."

The two AccECN option kinds (172 and 174) are used consistently throughout (figures, normative text, and IANA table), and their variable-length nature (with specific allowed lengths defined earlier) is compatible with using “N” in the registry. The instructions to IANA about updating registry references and notes are procedural/administrative rather than wire-format- or grammar‑affecting. They do not introduce ambiguity about bit positions, field sizes, option formats, or encodings, and therefore do not constitute structural or syntactic bugs from an implementability standpoint.",

The text directly interacts with the existing IANA “TCP Header Flags”, “TCP Option Kind Numbers”, and “TCP ExIDs” registries, and with the prior changes made by RFC 3540 and RFC 8311.\n- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Low\n- Issues: []\n- IfNoIssues:\n  - Comment: The IANA Considerations text is broadly consistent with the prior RFCs and registries it touches. RFC 3540 originally assigned bit 7 as NS, and RFC 8311 reclassified RFC 3540 as Historic and caused IANA to mark bit 7 as Reserved with an annotation that it had been used as NS  . The new draft correctly notes that history and reuses bit 7 for AE, which is exactly what one expects to do with a previously reserved flag; RFC 8311 does not impose a permanent prohibition on future use of bit 7, it only documents that, at the time, it was Reserved and no longer NS. Asking IANA to change the bit‑7 row from “Reserved” to “AE (Accurate ECN)” with an assignment note “Previously used as NS (Nonce Sum) by [RFC3540], which is now historic [RFC8311]” is aligned with both the prior status and current IANA practice; the reference column naturally moves to the RFC that defines the current semantics, while the note still points back to RFC 3540/RFC 8311 for history. Similarly, the handling of experimental options via ExIDs (0xACC0, 0xACC1, 0xACCE) is consistent with RFC 6994’s model (use 253/254 with ExIDs, register them, then migrate to assigned kinds later)  . The text merely updates the *references* for those ExIDs to point at the final AccECN RFC and encourages migration; it does not redefine or conflict with the TCP ExIDs registry. Finally, while one could argue that this document “logically” updates RFC 8311 (since it changes the status of bit 7 from Reserved to AE), RFC 8311’s only normative action on that bit is via IANA, and there is no ongoing behavioral requirement that would be contradicted; omitting “Updates: 8311” is at most an editorial matter and does not create implementer-visible ambiguity or registry inconsistency.",
