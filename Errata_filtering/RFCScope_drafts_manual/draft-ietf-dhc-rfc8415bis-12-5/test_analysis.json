      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Discusses message sequencing only at a descriptive level; detailed normative sequencing is in Section 18 and appears consistent."

        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Describes high-level cause/effect (e.g., Renew extends lifetimes, Reconfigure triggers client messages), but no obvious logical contradictions with the detailed procedures."

      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Section 5 largely avoids RFC 2119 keywords; normative requirements are elsewhere, so contradictions are unlikely here."

The descriptions of stateless vs stateful operation, two-message Rapid Commit vs four-message exchanges, Renew/Rebind, and Reconfigure-initiated flows appear consistent with those later sections and with RFC 8415 behavior. Phrases like “two-message exchange as described earlier” are informal cross-references rather than normative hooks, so they do not create interoperability problems. No plausible error rises to the level of an erratum candidate based on this excerpt."
