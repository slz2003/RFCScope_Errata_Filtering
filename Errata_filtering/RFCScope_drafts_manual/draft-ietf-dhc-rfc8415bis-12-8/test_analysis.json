    "excerpt_summary": "Section 8 defines the common fixed header and variable options area for DHCPv6 client/server messages, including the msg-type, transaction-id, and options layout, and references the message type list (Section 7.3) and option definitions (Section 21).",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Pure format description; no sequencing, timers, or state transitions involved."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Only says “between clients and servers” at a structural level; no send/receive role logic to check here."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Scope is clearly “client/server messages” (not relay), and references to Sections 7.3 and 21 are appropriate."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The format is straightforward and standard; no algorithmic cause→effect chains or behaviors that could break if misread."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Field sizes (1 octet msg-type, 3 octet transaction-id, options = total message size − 4 octets) are self-consistent and match existing DHCPv6 practice."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No normative behavior (MUST/SHOULD) in this section, just descriptive structure."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The bit diagram matches the prose and aligns with the generic option format in Section 21.1; no ABNF/YANG/etc. to cross-check here."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References (7.3 for types, 21 for options) are correct and in-scope; no external RFC numbers here."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Uses existing terms (msg-type, transaction-id, options) consistently with the rest of the draft and RFC 8415 lineage."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No edge cases or bounds behavior (e.g., empty option set) that would need additional rules; empty or minimal messages still have a well-defined structure."
