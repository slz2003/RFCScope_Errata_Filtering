You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 8 defines the common fixed header and variable options area for DHCPv6 client/server messages, including the msg-type, transaction-id, and options layout, and references the message type list (Section 7.3) and option definitions (Section 21).
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Pure format description; no sequencing, timers, or state transitions involved.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Only says “between clients and servers” at a structural level; no send/receive role logic to check here.
  - Scope: LOW - Scope is clearly “client/server messages” (not relay), and references to Sections 7.3 and 21 are appropriate.
  - Causal: LOW - The format is straightforward and standard; no algorithmic cause→effect chains or behaviors that could break if misread.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Field sizes (1 octet msg-type, 3 octet transaction-id, options = total message size − 4 octets) are self-consistent and match existing DHCPv6 practice.
  - Deontic: LOW - No normative behavior (MUST/SHOULD) in this section, just descriptive structure.
  - Structural: LOW - The bit diagram matches the prose and aligns with the generic option format in Section 21.1; no ABNF/YANG/etc. to cross-check here.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References (7.3 for types, 21 for options) are correct and in-scope; no external RFC numbers here.
  - Terminology: LOW - Uses existing terms (msg-type, transaction-id, options) consistently with the rest of the draft and RFC 8415 lineage.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge cases or bounds behavior (e.g., empty option set) that would need additional rules; empty or minimal messages still have a well-defined structure.
