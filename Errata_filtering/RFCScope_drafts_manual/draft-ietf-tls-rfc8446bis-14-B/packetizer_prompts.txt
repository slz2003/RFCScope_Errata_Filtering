You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

================================================================================

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section B defines the formal TLS 1.3 protocol data structures and constant values (record layer, alerts, handshake, extensions, cipher suites), largely as a consolidated, implementation-oriented restatement of definitions that also appear in the main body.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Section B is almost entirely type/constant definitions; no ordering or state-machine logic beyond what is already in the main text.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - The excerpt does not assign behaviors to client/server; it only declares shared data structures.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope (TLS 1.3 vs older versions) is already clarified in the surrounding appendix text; Section B itself is just structural.
  - Causal: LOW - These are declarative layouts; no algorithms or cause-effect chains are introduced here beyond what is specified elsewhere.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Lengths and ranges (e.g., vector floors, max sizes) match those in the main sections of the draft and RFC 8446; no clear numeric inconsistencies appear.
  - Deontic: LOW - Normative requirements (“MUST”, “MUST NOT”) about when to send/use these types are in earlier sections; Section B itself mostly omits new normative language.
  - Structural: LOW - The structures in B are consistent with the earlier definitions (e.g., in Sections 4, 5, 6); added *_RESERVED ranges simply restate registry content and do not contradict the main text.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Cross-references in comments (e.g., to RFC 6066, 7919, 8422, 8446, 8879, 9147) align with how those registries and code points are defined in the referenced RFCs.
  - Terminology: LOW - Where the same types appear both in the main body and in Appendix B (e.g., HandshakeType, ContentType, CertificateType), the differences are limited to inclusion of RESERVED values and are consistent with the stated intent that these are for backward compatibility only.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge cases (e.g., minimum lengths, empty vectors) follow the same constraints already explained in the main sections; no new edge behavior is introduced here.
