The surrounding sections and referenced RFCs define the underlying HHIT structure and clarify that this document’s scope is only DETs under 2001:30::/28 and their reverse DNS.\n\n- ScopeModel:\n  - Targets:\n    - DETs as HHITs encoded in the single IPv6 prefix 2001:30::/28, assigned in RFC 9374 for DET use and entered in the “IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry”.\n    - The reverse DNS subtree 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. as the ip6.arpa domain corresponding to 2001:30::/28, administered at the apex by IAB/IANA.\n    - The 14‑bit Registered Assigning Authority (RAA) and 14‑bit HHIT Domain Authority (HDA) fields within the 28‑bit HID inside a DET/HHIT, as defined in RFC 9374.\n    - Per‑RAA IPv6 “infrastructure” prefixes for delegation (described informally as 2001:3x:xxx0::/44 for RAAs and 2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56 for HDAs) and their corresponding reverse labels under 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa..\n    - Reserved HDA values (0, 4096, 8192, 12288) within each RAA’s HDA space, used for RAA operational purposes and DNS delegation structure.\n    - A subset of RAAs allocated to nations based on ISO 3166‑1 numeric country codes (four RAAs per nation in the 4–3999 range) as defined in the IANA “DRIP RAA Allocations” registry created by this document.\n    - DIME instances operating at three hierarchy levels (Apex, RAA, HDA) over this tree; and DNS “registries/registrars/registrants” mapped into apex (IANA), national (RAA), and local (HDA) roles, as in Figure 3’s example.\n  - Conditions:\n    - IPv6 reverse lookup names follow the nibble‑reverse scheme of RFC 3596 section 2.5 for ip6.arpa.\n    - Because of the bit‑level placement of RAA/HDA inside the 128‑bit HHIT and the nibble‑reversal used in ip6.arpa, the RAA level “borrows” the top two bits of its HDA field to obtain clean nibble boundaries for DNS delegation, resulting in 4 reserved HDA values per RAA.\n    - The document’s overall scope is explicitly limited to “DNS registration of DETs with the DNS delegation of the reverse domain of the IPv6 prefix (2001:30::/28 for DETs) and RRsets used to handle DETs”; other HHIT prefixes (if any) remain under the generic HHIT framework of RFC 9374.\n    - Administration, management, and policy for DIMEs at any level (Apex, RAA, HDA) is explicitly declared out of scope; for per‑country RAAs/DETs, those are to be determined by the appropriate national authority (typically the CAA).\n    - The registrant–registrar–registry model is described as an optional, DNS‑industry‑style deployment model; alternative models (IP‑address‑style delegations to third parties; dynamic registration) are allowed in principle but left to policy, not mandated.\n  - NotedAmbiguities:\n    - The shorthand address forms “2001:3x:xxx0::/44” (RAA) and “2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56” (HDA) are not formally defined in bit‑level terms here, and the meaning of the placeholder nibbles x and y has to be inferred from RFC 9374’s HID layout and DET encoding example.\n    - The term “apex” is used both for the DNS apex 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. (operated by IANA/IAB) and, in other DRIP documents, for the DET/PKI “Apex” entity; section 3 briefly mentions “Apex, RAA or HDA” DIMEs without explicitly re‑defining “apex”, which could require cross‑reading with the DKI draft.\n    - The sentence “HDA values of 0, 4096, 8192, and 12288 are reserved for operational use of an RAA” does not itself say “per‑RAA”, though section 6.2.1.3 and the RAA delegation form (Figure 6) make that per‑RAA scope clear.\n\n- CandidateIssues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: None\n    - ShortLabel: No scope-related inconsistency or underspecification found in the mapping of DET hierarchy to IPv6/ip6.arpa or the registry deployment models\n    - ScopeProblemType: None\n    - Evidence: \n      - The document clearly ties its technical scope to DETs under the fixed prefix 2001:30::/28 and the corresponding reverse domain 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa., matching the DET prefix and registry framework defined in RFC 9374.\n      - The RAA/HDA bit layout and reserved HDA values follow directly from the HHIT structure and the need to align DNS delegations on nibble boundaries, and section 6.2.1.3 explicitly states that “a single RAA is given 4 delegations … These HDAs (0, 4096, 8192 and 12288) are reserved for the RAA”, which matches the summary in section 3.\n      - The IANA “DRIP RAA Allocations” registry (section 6.2.1 and Table 1) makes explicit that only a specific numeric range (4–3999) is tied to ISO 3166‑1 country codes and IESG‑approved allocations, while other ranges are Reserved, Unassigned (FCFS), or Private Use; section 3’s “preallocates a subset of RAAs based on the ISO 3166‑1 Numeric Nation Code” simply points to this, not to a broader or conflicting scope.\n      - Section 3.1.1’s Figure 3 is explicitly labeled as an “Example DRIP DNS Model” and its narrative text describes multiple possible registration deployment approaches (classic domain‑name model, IP‑style delegation, dynamic registration) as policy choices, while repeatedly marking registration policies and DIME operational details as out of scope for this document.\n    - DetailedReasoning:\n      - The most critical scope question is whether the IPv6 prefix and reverse‑DNS mapping rules in section 3 align with the HHIT/DET structure defined in RFC 9374 and with the document’s own stated scope. RFC 9374 assigns 2001:30::/28 as the DET prefix and defines HID = RAA|HDA as 28 bits immediately following that prefix; RFC 9886 restates that exact prefix and derives the reverse domain 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. consistently with RFC 3596’s nibble‑reverse scheme.\n      - The potentially subtle part is the “borrowing” of the upper two HDA bits to obtain clean hexadecimal nibble boundaries for delegation. The document summarizes this with informal shorthand prefixes for RAA and HDA levels and then, in section 6.2.1.3 and Figure 7, walks through an explicit bit layout for RAA=16376 and the four corresponding HDA values (0, 4096, 8192, 12288) used for that RAA’s delegations. This is exactly what you would expect from the 14‑bit RAA/14‑bit HDA split in RFC 9374, so there is no evidence of an incorrect or mismatched scope (e.g., using HDA‑scoped constructs at the wrong hierarchy level).\n      - The phrase “HDA values of 0, 4096, 8192, and 12288 are reserved for operational use of an RAA” could have been misread as reserving those HDA *numbers* globally rather than per RAA, but the very next normative treatment in 6.2.1.3 clearly states that “a single RAA is given 4 delegations” and that these HDAs “are reserved for the RAA”; together, the text is reasonably clear that the reservation is per‑RAA within that RAA’s HDA space. There is no conflicting statement elsewhere that would extend or narrow this reservation incorrectly.\n      - For RAAs, section 3 briefly notes that “this document preallocates a subset of RAAs based on the ISO 3166‑1 Numeric Nation Code” and points to section 6.2.1; that IANA section then carefully scopes only the 4–3999 range to ISO‑3166‑based national RAAs and leaves other ranges Reserved, Unassigned (FCFS), or Private Use. Thus, the apparent scope “for countries” is explicitly a subset, not implicitly global to all RAAs, and the later table prevents misinterpretation.\n      - On the deployment‑model side, section 3.1 and 3.1.1 deliberately frame the registrant/registrar/registry roles as “DNS Model Considerations for DIMEs”, give a clearly marked example hierarchy (apex IANA, national RAAs, local HDAs, registrants), and then immediately discuss that this classic DNS model “may not be appropriate for DRIP registrations in some circumstances” and that registration policies (pricing, renewals, agreements, etc.) “will need to be developed” and “are out of scope for this document”. That explicit out‑of‑scope statement keeps these deployment sketches from accidentally becoming protocol‑level requirements with too‑broad scope.\n      - The overlapping use of the word “apex” (DNS apex vs. DET/PKI apex) is potentially confusing at a terminology level, but in the specific text under review, “Apex” in Figure 3 is clearly tied to the 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. zone managed by IANA, while the more general statement about “operation of a DIME at any level in the hierarchy (Apex, RAA or HDA)” explicitly pushes all such operational policy out of scope. There is no place where conflicting rules are given for which entities must implement which behavior, so this does not rise to a scope bug for implementers.\n      - Overall, the mapping from DET fields (RAA/HDA within 2001:30::/28) to nibble‑reversed ip6.arpa names, and the allocation of RAAs and reserved HDA values, are consistently scoped to the DET prefix and its reverse domain. Alternative DNS tree (20010030.hhit.arpa.) and wider HHIT uses remain governed by RFC 9374 and other DRIP documents. Implementers following the text literally will construct the correct reverse‑DNS hierarchy for DETs and will not be forced into undefined behavior for other HHIT prefixes or registry types.\n\n- ResidualUncertainties:\n  - The shorthand forms 2001:3x:xxx0::/44 and 2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56 rely on an implicit understanding of how RAA/HDA bits interleave with the DET prefix; while RFC 9374’s DET encoding example clarifies this, a more explicit bit‑level restatement in RFC 9886 might have reduced implementer cognitive load.\n  - The document defers all DIME operational and policy questions (e.g., how exactly the reserved HDAs are used to “specify when to register with the apex”) to national authorities and other DRIP documents, which is intentional but means some deployment patterns will only be fully specified once those companion documents are read.",

      "analysis": "1. **Summary**\n\nFollowing Section 3 of RFC 9886 literally yields a coherent, implementable mapping from DET/HHIT hierarchy (RAA/HDA) into IPv6 prefixes and the ip6.arpa reverse tree, and the described apex/RAA/HDA deployment models for DIMEs are operationally plausible. The prefix and nibble-reversal formulas line up with the HHIT bit layout in RFC 9374 and with the worked examples in Appendix A of RFC 9886. I do not see a fundamental causal breakage inside this section.\n\nThe main thing to be aware of is a *cross‑RFC tension* with RFC 9374’s earlier, more permissive DNS-model text; that’s a policy/interoperability choice rather than a mechanical bug in the Section 3 mapping itself.\n\n---\n\n2. **Causal Analysis**\n\n### 2.1. Mapping DETs to ip6.arpa and bit/nibble consistency\n\nKey facts:\n\n- DETs use IPv6 prefix **2001:30::/28**   (RFC 9886 §1.2, §3, RFC 9374 §3.1, §8.2.1).\n- Reverse domain for that prefix is **3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.**   (RFC 9886 §3).\n- An HHIT/DET embeds:\n  - Prefix: 28 bits\n  - HID: 28 bits = 14‑bit RAA + 14‑bit HDA\n  - HHSI: 8 bits\n  - ORCHID hash: 64 bits   (RFC 9374 §3, §3.5.1, §3.5.2).\n\nSection 3 of RFC 9886 adds:\n\n> “Due to the nature of the hierarchy split and its relationship to nibble reversing of the IPv6 address … the upper level of the hierarchy (i.e., RAA) ‘borrows’ the upper two bits of their respective HDA space for DNS delegation. As such, the IPv6 prefix of RAAs is **2001:3x:xxx0::/44** and HDAs is **2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56** with respective nibble reverse domains of **x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.** and **y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.**  \n\nMechanically:\n\n- **/28 prefix** uses 7 hex nibbles. For 2001:30::, those are `2 0 0 1 0 0 3`; nibble 8 onward (the trailing ‘0’ of “30”) and subsequent nibbles carry HID + HHSI + hash.\n- **RAA‑level /44**: 28 (prefix) + 14 (RAA) + 2 (top bits of HDA) = 44 bits = 11 nibbles. Those 4 borrowed HDA bits let RAA boundaries fall on nibble boundaries in ip6.arpa, which is required for DNS delegation units.\n- **HDA‑level /56**: 28 (prefix) + 28 (HID) = 56 bits = 14 nibbles; that is exactly prefix + full HID. HHSI and ORCHID hash (8+64 bits) start after /56.\n\nThe stated reverse zones:\n\n- RAA: 11 nibbles → `x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.` (4 variable nibbles for RAA+HDA_hi, then the 7‑nibble DET prefix) is exactly a /44 zone.\n- HDA: 14 nibbles → `y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.` (7 variable nibbles—full HID when decoded—plus the 7‑nibble prefix) is exactly a /56 zone.\n\nThis matches both:\n\n- The HHIT structure in RFC 9374, where **prefix+HID are 56 bits** and the rest is suite ID + hash.    \n- The explicit “bit borrowing” description and diagram in RFC 9886 §6.2.1.3 (Figure 7), where one RAA gets four special HDA values 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, identified as the four combinations of the two borrowed HDA bits  .\n\nThe worked addresses and zone names in Appendix A confirm that when you actually:\n\n- Take a concrete RAA/HDA/DET,\n- Form the IPv6 address accordingly, and\n- Nibble‑reverse it,\n\nyou land under the expected portion of the reverse tree. For example, the RAA authentication HHIT at:\n\n- IPv6: **2001:3f:fe00:5:5e60:a157:1e91:a0b7**  \n- Has its reverse zone origin set to:\n\n  `5.0.0.0.0.0.e.f.f.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.example.com.`  \n\n  which, when the labels are reversed, yields `2001:3f:fe00:5::/64`. This is exactly the kind of more‑specific prefix lying under a RAA’s `/44` and HDA’s `/56` space.  \n\nIn other words: the apparent complexity in the “2001:3x:xxx0::/44” and reverse “x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2” forms is just the usual interaction of:\n\n- A non‑nibble‑aligned original prefix (/28),\n- A structured hierarchy (28 HID bits),\n- And the nibble‑reversed ip6.arpa scheme.\n\nFollowing those formulas literally produces a consistent mapping. There’s no missing field or impossible computation.\n\n### 2.2. Borrowed HDA bits and reserved HDA values\n\nSection 3 states:\n\n> “The HDA values of 0, 4096, 8192, and 12288 are reserved for operational use of an RAA (a by-product of the above mentioned borrowing of bits)….”  \n\nThose decimal values are 0x0000, 0x1000, 0x2000, 0x3000 in the 14‑bit HDA namespace—i.e., the four combinations of the top two HDA bits with all lower 12 HDA bits zero. This is exactly what you’d expect as the four HDA “anchors” implied by borrowing the top two bits.\n\nCausally:\n\n- DET construction in RFC 9374 is not changed: HDA remains a 14‑bit field with all 0..16383 values syntactically possible.  \n- RFC 9886 treats those four values as *reserved for operational/DNS use* (apex/RAA delegations etc.), which is purely a registry and allocation constraint, not a change in on‑the‑wire format.\n- No step in DET parsing or validation depends on HDA being non‑zero or non‑multiple of 4096, so DETs with those HDAs can still exist for RAA‑operational entities (as in the examples).\n\nHence, “borrowing” upper HDA bits for DNS delegation does not make the space unrealizable or ambiguous. It simply shrinks the pool of HDAs available for “ordinary” delegation by 4 per RAA, which is intentional and explicit.\n\n### 2.3. Registry / registrar / DIME deployment model\n\nSection 3.1 and Figure 3 sketch a DNS‑style registry–registrar–registrant model mapped onto:\n\n- Apex (3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.; IANA/ICAO‑mediated)  \n- “National” registries/registrars (RAA layer; e.g., per‑country CAAs).\n- “Local” registries/registrars (HDA layer; e.g., USSs, manufacturers).\n- Registrants (individual DET owners/operators)  .\n\nThis is descriptive; it does not impose any impossible obligations. DNS and RDAP interaction between these parties is intentionally not specified in detail, and is offloaded to policy and existing DNS/EPP/RDAP practices later in the document (§3.1.1, §7.1). There is no hidden demand for a party to send or receive a message type they cannot send, nor any circular dependence.\n\nDynamic registration (e.g., per‑flight ephemeral records) is explicitly called out as non‑scaling in some environments and left to local policy, not mandated as the only model.  \n\nSo the deployment model is underspecified by design, but not in a way that makes the protocol or the name hierarchy unusable.\n\n### 2.4. Interaction with RFC 9374’s DNS text\n\nRFC 9374 §5 described two *possible* ways to use DNS with DETs:\n\n- FQDNs like `20010030.hhit.arpa.`\n- Reverse DNS as IPv6 addresses per RFC 8005/ip6.arpa  \n\nRFC 9886 narrows the scope and says:\n\n- “DETs, being IPv6 addresses, are to be under ip6.arpa. … and MUST resolve to an HHIT RRType.”  \n\nCausally:\n\n- A deployment that follows RFC 9886 will put DET records only under **ip6.arpa**, relying on the mapping in §3 and the HHIT/BRID RRs.\n- A deployment that followed RFC 9374 early and chose only the **hhit.arpa** FQDN model, ignoring ip6.arpa, would be non‑interoperable with 9886‑compliant resolvers that expect reverse ip6.arpa zones.\n\nThis is a cross‑document tension, but:\n\n- RFC 9374 never *required* the hhit.arpa model; it was an example and explicitly said it did not recommend a single approach and that more DNS considerations would be covered in later documents.  \n- RFC 9886 effectively provides that later, more precise guidance and gives a concrete **MUST** for using ip6.arpa.\n\nSo from a causality standpoint inside RFC 9886, the behavior is defined and workable. The risk is historical heterogeneity if someone implements only the older option from RFC 9374 and never updates, but that does not reflect an internal inconsistency in the §3 mapping itself.\n\n---\n\n3. **Problem Classification**\n\nWithin Section 3 of RFC 9886, I do **not** see:\n\n- Any step that is mechanically impossible to execute.\n- Any state machine branch that lacks a next step.\n- Any irreversible or ambiguous mapping in the IPv6⇄ip6.arpa hierarchy that would make lookups fail for honest implementations.\n\nThe only notable issue is:\n\n- A **cross‑RFC interoperability risk**: RFC 9886 standardizes ip6.arpa use and reverse‑mapping structure, while RFC 9374 earlier left room for a different DNS deployment model (hhit.arpa FQDNs). This is best characterized as **Causal Underspecification at the ecosystem level**—the combined corpus does not explicitly state that the earlier flexibility is superseded, so legacy deployments could diverge.\n\nBut **within the scope of Section 3’s hierarchy and mapping**, behavior is causally consistent.\n\n---\n\n4. **Minimal Fix Shape (for the cross‑RFC tension, optional)**\n\nIf desired, the ecosystem‑level underspecification can be cleaned up by a small, global clarification rather than altering the Section 3 algorithms:\n\n- Add an explicit statement (either in an update to RFC 9374 or in an applicability note) that **ip6.arpa reverse mapping as specified in RFC 9886 is the interoperable DRIP DET DNS model**, and that the hhit.arpa FQDN approach in RFC 9374 §5 is deprecated or for private/experimental use only.\n\nThis would align all implementers on one DNS model and remove any ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n5. **Non‑Issues (explicitly checked)**\n\n- The “borrowing” of top two HDA bits for RAA delegation does not corrupt HHIT semantics or make HHIT decoding ambiguous; it only shapes DNS zone boundaries.\n- The informal IPv6 prefix notations `2001:3x:xxx0::/44` and `2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56` are consistent with the bit layout and with the ip6.arpa names; they are not misaligned masks.\n- Reserving HDA values (0, 4096, 8192, 12288) is a policy allocation choice, not a protocol contradiction with RFC 9374’s definition of the HDA field.\n- The registry/registrar/registrant model and the various static/dynamic registration approaches do not demand any impossible protocol messages; they are deployment models sitting on top of a standard DNS hierarchy.",

It also introduces the “bit borrowing” of the upper 2 bits of HDA to get nibble‑aligned delegation prefixes (RAA at /44, HDA at /56), reserves four specific HDA values (0, 4096, 8192, 12288), and shows example ip6.arpa zones and certificates that instantiate these rules.\n\n- Issues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: None\n    - ShortLabel: No quantitative issues found\n    - Description: The numeric layout of DETs (prefix + HID + Suite + hash), the bit borrowing for RAA/HDA, the IPv6 prefix lengths, and the nibble-reversed ip6.arpa forms are internally consistent and match the examples and the base HHIT specification in RFC 9374. While the notation using “x” and “y” in the prefixes is compact and conceptually heavy, it does not create an actual inconsistency or an implementability gap when combined with RFC 9374 and RFC 3596.\n    - Evidence:\n      - DET format is stated as IPv6 Prefix (28 bits) + Hierarchy ID (28 bits) + HHIT Suite ID (8 bits) + ORCHID Hash (64 bits), matching RFC 9374’s HHIT format (28+28+8+64 = 128 bits).\n      - The DET prefix 2001:30::/28 correctly maps to the reverse domain 3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa via nibble reversal as defined in RFC 3596 §2.5.\n      - Bit borrowing is described as RAA “borrowing” the upper two bits of its HDA space for delegation, leading to RAA IPv6 prefixes 2001:3x:xxx0::/44 and HDA IPv6 prefixes 2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56, with corresponding reverse domains x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. (for /44) and y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. (for /56).\n      - /44 corresponds to 11 nibbles (11 labels in ip6.arpa), and the RAA reverse form shows exactly 11 hex nibbles (four x’s plus the seven fixed “3.0.0.1.0.0.2”), while /56 corresponds to 14 nibbles, and the HDA reverse form shows 14 hex nibbles (three y’s + four x’s + the same seven fixed digits).\n      - HDA values 0, 4096, 8192, 12288 are exactly the four possible settings of the top 2 bits of a 14‑bit HDA (00, 01, 10, 11) times 2^12, which is consistent with “borrowing” the upper two HDA bits for the /44 RAA alignment while leaving the lower 12 bits to vary within a /56.\n      - Section 6.2.1.3’s worked example for RAA=16376 and its derived HID hex pattern, together with the example IPs and reverse-zone origins in Appendix A (e.g., $ORIGIN 5.0.0.0.0.0.e.f.f.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.example.com. for that RAA and $ORIGIN 5.0.a.0.0.0.e.f.f.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.example.com. for an HDA) are consistent with the stated /44 and /56 reverse-domain templates and with RFC 3596’s nibble-reversal rules.\n      - The RAA registry ranges (0–3 reserved, 4–3999 mapped to ISO 3166‑1 countries with 4 RAAs per country, 4000–8191 reserved, 8192–15359 unassigned FCFS, 15360–16383 private use) align with the 14‑bit field size (0–16383) and the “4 RAAs per numeric country code” design (999×4 = 3996 slots fitting into 4–3999).\n    - QuantitativeReasoning:  \n      - Field sizes sum correctly (28+28+8+64 = 128 bits) and are consistent between RFC 9886 and RFC 9374.  \n      - The prefix lengths /28, /44, /56 correspond to 7, 11, and 14 hex nibbles respectively; the reverse-domain templates for RAA and HDA use exactly those numbers of nibble labels. The 28‑bit HID is expressed as 4 “x” nibbles (16 bits = RAA + top 2 HDA bits) plus 3 “y” nibbles (12 bits = remaining HDA bits), matching the 14+14 structure with 2 bits borrowed.  \n      - The reserved HDA values are 0×2^12, 1×2^12, 2×2^12, 3×2^12, i.e., 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, which is exactly what you get when you fix the top 2 bits of a 14‑bit HDA and zero the remaining 12 bits. These four special HDAs then correspond to the four /56 blocks neatly aligned under the /44 RAA prefix, as described.\n      - The numeric layout visible in the example addresses and reverse names (e.g., 2001:3f:fe00:5:… mapping to …5.0.0.0.0.0.e.f.f.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.example.com.) matches the general formulas when decoded as nibble-reverse per RFC 3596, confirming that the compact “3x:xxx0” and “xxxy:yy00” notations are consistent with the bit-level HHIT layout.\n    - Consequences: Since the bit widths, prefix lengths, and reserved values are consistent across the prose, the IANA tables, and the worked examples, independent implementations that follow RFC 9374’s HHIT construction and RFC 3596’s nibble reversal will derive the same IPv6 prefixes and ip6.arpa domains for each RAA/HDA. There is no evident quantitative ambiguity that would lead different implementers to encode different bits into different places or to delegate different subtrees, so no interoperability or deployment problem arises from the numeric structure as specified.",

This phrasing implies that the definition of the DNS “HHIT records” (i.e., the RRType and wire format) is in RFC 9374. However, RFC 9374 only defines the DET/HHIT address format and gives example DNS usage (FQDNs and reverse lookups), and relies on existing HIP DNS RRs [RFC8005] for storing HIs; it does not define a distinct “HHIT” RRType. The actual HHIT DNS RRType (RRType 67) and its CBOR wire format are newly defined in Section 5.1 of RFC 9886 itself. Thus, the bracketed reference “[RFC9374]” next to “HHIT records” incorrectly points implementers to the wrong document for the DNS record format and may cause confusion about where the RRType is specified.

An implementer following the Section 3.1.1 wording literally could look to RFC 9374 for the “HHIT records” and end up using only the HIP RR or other mechanisms from RFC 9374, missing that the normative DNS representation for HHIT metadata in this document is the new HHIT RRType. To align the cross-document story, the reference in Section 3.1.1 should point to the HHIT RRType defined in RFC 9886 (Section 5.1) as the record being provisioned, with RFC 9374 cited only for the DET/HHIT semantics and the DET prefix.

In DNS notation, the *single* trailing dot indicates a fully-qualified domain name; a second dot would correspond to an empty additional label and is syntactically invalid.\n      - Since this reverse domain is the canonical name for the DET reverse tree, implementers are likely to copy it literally into zone files, documentation, or code. The double-dot form would fail in standard DNS tooling, while the single-dot form elsewhere in the same RFC is correct.

RFC 9374 defines HHIT/DET structure and describes how DETs may be used in DNS (FQDN and PTR), but it does not define a new RRType or “HHIT record” as such.\n      - A careful implementer trying to understand what DNS record to provision would be misdirected to RFC 9374 looking for a record/RRType specification that isn’t there, instead of to Section 5.1 of RFC 9886 where the HHIT RRType is actually specified.

From that, the “raw” RAA portion has 14 bits, which, when added to the 28‑bit prefix, would give a /42 boundary that does not align with 4‑bit nibbles required by the ip6.arpa scheme in RFC 3596  . Borrowing the top two bits of HDA to make a 16‑bit RAA+2 composite gives clean /44 nibble alignment; mathematically this corresponds to taking (RAA << 2) | floor(HDA / 4096) as the 16‑bit segment after the 28‑bit prefix. The reserved HDA values 0, 4096, 8192, and 12288 are exactly the first values in each 4096‑wide block, so they realize the four combinations of those two borrowed bits (00, 01, 10, 11) per RAA without restricting use of the remaining 16380 HDA values. For /44 prefixes, only the first 11 nibbles (28 + 16 bits) participate in the reverse name; reversing those yields the pattern x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa, consistent with the example DET and zone origins given in Appendix A  . Similarly, a /56 HDA prefix includes all 28 HID bits (RAA+HDA), so the 14 reversed nibbles naturally follow the stated y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2 pattern. Because the placement of RAA and HDA bits in the 128‑bit IPv6 value is already normatively defined and unambiguous in RFC 9374, and the ip6.arpa nibble reversal algorithm is normatively defined in RFC 3596, there is no additional behavioral choice left to implementers: the “x” and “y” placeholders in 2001:3x:xxx0::/44 and 2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56 are simply whatever nibble values come out of that fixed bit ordering.\n    - ImpactAssessment: All boundary combinations (lowest and highest RAA and HDA values, including the special HDA values and the transitions at 4095/4096, 8191/8192, 12287/12288) map deterministically into IPv6 prefixes and ip6.arpa names using the common rules from RFC 9374 and RFC 3596. Different implementations that follow those RFCs will necessarily compute the same prefixes and reverse domains, so there is no interoperability‑relevant ambiguity or contradiction here, even in the “weird” edges created by bit‑borrowing.\n\n- Notes:\n  - Not a bug: The text in Section 3 is somewhat informal (“2001:3x:xxx0::/44”, “x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.”) and does not spell out the exact bit‑to‑nibble mapping for arbitrary RAA/HDA values, but since that mapping is already fixed and normatively specified in RFC 9374 and RFC 3596, the informality does not translate into undefined behavior. An implementer cannot choose an alternative but still standards‑compliant mapping, so this is a documentation‑style concern rather than a boundary/exceptional‑case specification bug.",
