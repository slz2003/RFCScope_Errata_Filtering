You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

USER PROMPT
================================================================================

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 1 of RFC 9887 introduces TACACS+ over TLS, explains that legacy TACACS+ (per RFC 8907) has weak “obfuscation”-based protection, and states that this document updates TACACS+ to use TLS 1.3 for authentication and encryption while obsoleting the obfuscation mechanism.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Purely introductory; no sequencing, timers, or state transitions are specified here.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Only high-level mention of clients/servers; no send/receive rules or role-specific behavior defined.
  - Scope: LOW - States that the document updates TACACS+ and obsoletes obfuscation, but the detailed scoping is in later sections, not here.
  - Causal: LOW - Describes motivation (weak security ⇒ need TLS) but no executable algorithm or behavior whose consequences must be reasoned through.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No sizes, counts, or numeric limits appear in this section.
  - Deontic: LOW - No RFC 2119 keywords in Section 1; normative force comes later.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF, YANG, diagrams, or other formal structures in this section.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References RFC 8907 (TACACS+) and RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3) in a standard way; no section numbers or detailed cross-RFC dependencies here that look suspect.
  - Terminology: LOW - Uses “obfuscation” consistently with RFC 8907’s terminology and correctly distinguishes it from encryption; no apparent naming inconsistencies.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge cases or exceptional behaviors described in this introductory text.

Candidate Issues: 1

  Issue 1:
    Type: None
    Label: No apparent specification or consistency errors in the introductory text
    Relevant Dimensions: 
    Sketch: Section 1 is descriptive motivation and high-level positioning: it notes that TACACS+ obfuscation (R...
