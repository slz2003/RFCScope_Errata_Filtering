Let us analyze section 1 of RFC 9887. All references made by section 1 have also been included below.

# RFC 9887: Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) over TLS 1.3

## 1. Introduction

   "The Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+)
   Protocol" [RFC8907] provides device administration for routers,
   network access servers, and other networked computing devices via one
   or more centralized TACACS+ servers.  The protocol provides
   authentication, authorization, and accounting services (AAA) for
   TACACS+ clients within the device administration use case.

   The content of the protocol is highly sensitive and requires secure
   transport to safeguard a deployment.  However, TACACS+ lacks
   effective confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the
   connection and network traffic between the TACACS+ server and client.
   The security mechanisms as described in Section 4.5 of [RFC8907] are
   extremely weak.

   To address these deficiencies, this document updates the TACACS+
   protocol to use TLS 1.3 authentication and encryption [RFC8446], and
   obsoletes the use of TACACS+ obfuscation mechanisms.  The maturity of
   TLS in version 1.3 and above makes it a suitable choice for the
   TACACS+ protocol.

## 2. Technical Definitions

   The terms defined in Section 3 of [RFC8907] are fully applicable here
   and will not be repeated.  The following terms are also used in this
   document.

   Obfuscation:  TACACS+ was originally intended to incorporate a
      mechanism for securing the body of its packets.  The algorithm is
      categorized as obfuscation in Section 10.5.2 of [RFC8907].  The
      term is used to ensure that the algorithm is not mistaken for
      encryption.  It should not be considered secure.

   Non-TLS connection:  This term refers to the connection defined in
      [RFC8907].  It is a connection without TLS, using the unsecure
      TACACS+ authentication and obfuscation (or the unobfuscated option
      for testing).  The use of well-known TCP/IP host port number 49 is
      specified as the default for non-TLS connections.

   TLS connection:  A TLS connection is a TCP/IP connection with TLS
      authentication and encryption used by TACACS+ for transport.  A
      TLS connection for TACACS+ is always between one TACACS+ client
      and one TACACS+ server.

   TLS TACACS+ server:  This document describes a variant of the TACACS+
      server, introduced in Section 3.2 of [RFC8907], which utilizes TLS
      for transport, and makes some associated protocol optimizations.
      Both server variants respond to TACACS+ traffic, but this document
      specifically defines a TACACS+ server (whether TLS or non-TLS) as
      being bound to a specific port number on a particular IP address
      or hostname.  This definition is important in the context of the
      configuration of TACACS+ clients to ensure they direct their
      traffic to the correct TACACS+ servers.

   Peer:  The peer of a TACACS+ client (or server) in the context of a
      TACACS+ connection, is a TACACS+ server (or client).  Together,
      the ends of a TACACS+ connection are referred to as peers.

### 2.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

## 3. TACACS+ over TLS

   TACACS+ over TLS takes the protocol defined in [RFC8907], removes the
   option for obfuscation, and specifies that TLS 1.3 be used for
   transport (Section 3.1 elaborates on TLS version support).  A new
   well-known default host port number is used.  The next sections
   provide further details and guidance.

   TLS is introduced into TACACS+ to fulfill the following requirements:

   1.  Confidentiality and Integrity: The MD5 algorithm underlying the
       obfuscation mechanism specified in [RFC8907] has been shown to be
       insecure [RFC6151] when used for encryption.  This prevents
       TACACS+ from being used in a deployment compliant with
       [FIPS-140-3].  Securing the TACACS+ protocol with TLS is intended
       to provide confidentiality and integrity without requiring the
       provision of a secured network.

   2.  Peer authentication: The authentication capabilities of TLS
       replace the shared secrets of obfuscation for mutual
       authentication.

   This document adheres to the recommendations in [REQ-TLS13].

### 3.1. Separating TLS Connections

   Peers implementing the TACACS+ protocol variant defined in this
   document MUST apply mutual authentication and encrypt all data
   exchanged between them.  Therefore, when a TCP connection is
   established for the service, a TLS handshake begins immediately.
   Options that upgrade an initial non-TLS connection MUST NOT be used;
   see Section 5.3.

   To ensure clear separation between TACACS+ traffic using TLS and that
   which does not (see Section 5.3), servers supporting TACACS+ over TLS
   MUST listen on a TCP/IP port distinct from that used by non-TLS
   TACACS+ servers.  It is further RECOMMENDED to deploy the TLS and
   non-TLS services on separate hosts, as discussed in Section 5.1.1.

   Given the prevalence of default port usage in existing TACACS+ client
   implementations, this specification assigns the well-known TCP port
   number 300 for TACACS+ over TLS (see Section 7).

   While the use of the designated port number is strongly encouraged,
   deployments with specific requirements MAY use alternative TCP port
   numbers.  In such cases, operators must carefully consider the
   operational implications described in Section 5.3.

### 3.2. TLS Connection

   A TACACS+ client initiates a TLS connection by making a TCP
   connection to a configured TLS TACACS+ server on the TACACS+ TLS port
   number.  Once the TCP connection is established, the client MUST
   immediately begin the TLS negotiation before sending any TACACS+
   protocol data.

   A minimum of TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] MUST be used for transport.  It is
   expected that TACACS+, as described in this document, will work with
   future versions of TLS.  Earlier versions of TLS MUST NOT be used.

   Once the TLS connection has been successfully established, the
   exchange of TACACS+ data MUST proceed in accordance with the
   procedures defined in [RFC8907].  However, all TACACS+ messages SHALL
   be transmitted as TLS application data.  The TACACS+ obfuscation
   mechanism defined in [RFC8907] MUST NOT be applied when operating
   over TLS (Section 4).

   TLS TACACS+ connections are generally not long-lived.  The connection
   will be closed by either a peer if it encounters an error or an
   inactivity timeout.

   For connections not operating in Single Connection Mode (as defined
   in Section 4.3 of [RFC8907]), the TCP session SHALL be closed upon
   completion of the associated TACACS+ session.  Connections operating
   in Single Connection Mode MAY persist for a longer duration but are
   typically subject to timeout and closure after a brief period of
   inactivity.  Consequently, support for transport-layer keepalive
   mechanisms is not required.

   Why a connection is closed has no bearing on TLS resumption, unless
   closed by a TLS error, in which case it is possible that the ticket
   has been invalidated.

   TACACS+ clients and servers widely support IPv6 configuration in
   addition to IPv4.  This document makes no changes to recommendations
   in this area.

### 3.3. TLS Authentication Options

   Implementations MUST support certificate-based mutual authentication,
   to provide a core option for interoperability between deployments.
   This authentication option is specified in Section 3.4.

   In addition to certificate-based TLS authentication, implementations
   MAY support the following alternative authentication mechanisms:

   *  Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) (Section 3.5), also known as external PSKs
      in TLS 1.3.

   *  Raw Public Keys (RPKs).  The details of RPKs are considered out of
      scope for this document.  Refer to [RFC7250] and Section 4.4.2 of
      [RFC8446] for implementation, deployment, and security
      considerations.

### 3.4. TLS Certificate-Based Authentication

   TLS certificate authentication is the primary authentication option
   for TACACS+ over TLS.  This section covers certificate-based
   authentication only.

   Deploying TLS certificate-based authentication correctly will
   considerably improve the security of TACACS+ deployments.  It is
   essential for implementers and operators to understand the
   implications of a TLS certificate-based authentication solution,
   including the correct handling of certificates, Certificate
   Authorities (CAs), and all elements of TLS configuration.  For
   guidance, start with [BCP195].

   Each peer MUST validate the certificate path of its remote peer,
   including revocation checking, as described in Section 3.4.1.

   If the verification succeeds, the authentication is successful and
   the connection is permitted.  Policy may impose further constraints
   upon the peer, allowing or denying the connection based on
   certificate fields or any other parameters exposed by the
   implementation.

   Unless disabled by configuration, a peer MUST NOT permit connection
   of any peer that presents an invalid TLS certificate.

#### 3.4.1. TLS Certificate Path Verification

   The implementation of certificate-based mutual authentication MUST
   support certificate path validation as described in Section 6 of
   [RFC5280].

   In some deployments, a peer may be isolated from a remote peer's CA.
   Implementations for these deployments MUST support certificate chains
   (aka bundles or chains of trust), where the entire chain of the
   remote peer's certificate is stored on the local peer.

   TLS Cached Information Extension [RFC7924] SHOULD be implemented.
   This MAY be augmented with RPKs [RFC7250], though revocation must be
   handled as it is not part of that specification.

   Other approaches may be used for loading the intermediate
   certificates onto the client, but they MUST include support for
   revocation checking.  For example, [RFC5280] details the Authority
   Information Access (AIA) extension to provide information about the
   issuer of the certificate in which the extension appears.  It can be
   used to provide the address of the Online Certificate Status Protocol
   (OCSP) responder from where the revocation status of the certificate
   (which includes the extension) can be checked.

#### 3.4.2. TLS Certificate Identification

   For the client-side validation of presented TLS TACACS+ server
   identities, implementations MUST follow the validation techniques
   defined in [RFC9525].  Identifier types DNS-ID, IP-ID, or SRV-ID are
   applicable for use with the TLS TACACS+ protocol; they are selected
   by operators depending upon the deployment design.  TLS TACACS+ does
   not use URI-IDs for TLS TACACS+ server identity verification.

   Wildcards in TLS TACACS+ server identities simplify certificate
   management by allowing a single certificate to secure multiple
   servers in a deployment.  However, this introduces security risks, as
   compromising the private key of a wildcard certificate impacts all
   servers using it.  To address these risks, the guidelines in Section 6.3 of [RFC9525] MUST be followed, and the wildcard SHOULD be
   confined to a subdomain dedicated solely to TACACS+ servers.

   For the TLS TACACS+ server-side validation of client identities,
   implementations MUST support the ability to configure which fields of
   a certificate are used for client identification to verify that the
   client is a valid source for the received certificate and that it is
   permitted access to TACACS+. Implementations MUST support either:

   *  Network-address-based validation methods as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC5425] or

   *  Client Identity validation of a shared identity in the certificate
      subjectAltName.  This is applicable in deployments where the
      client securely supports an identity which is shared with the TLS
      TACACS+ server.  Matching of dNSName and iPAddress MUST be
      supported.  Other options defined in Section 4.2.1.6 of [RFC5280]      MAY be supported.  This approach allows a client's network
      location to be reconfigured without issuing a new client
      certificate.

   Implementations MUST support the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI)
   extension (Section 3 of [RFC6066]).  TLS TACACS+ clients MUST support
   the ability to configure the TLS TACACS+ server's domain name, so
   that it may be included in the SNI "server_name" extension of the
   client hello (This is distinct from the IP Address or hostname
   configuration used for the TCP connection).  Refer to Section 5.1.5   for security related operator considerations.

   Certificate provisioning is out of scope of this document.

#### 3.4.3. Cipher Suites Requirements

   Implementations MUST support the TLS 1.3 mandatory cipher suites
   (Section 9.1 of [RFC8446]).  Readers should refer to [BCP195].  The
   cipher suites offered or accepted SHOULD be configurable so that
   operators can adapt.

### 3.5. TLS PSK Authentication

   As an alternative to certificate-based authentication,
   implementations MAY support PSKs, also known as external PSKs in TLS
   1.3 [RFC8446].  These should not be confused with resumption PSKs.

   The use of external PSKs is less well established than certificate-
   based authentication.  It is RECOMMENDED that systems follow the
   directions of [RFC9257] and Section 4 of [RFC8446].

   Where PSK authentication is implemented, PSK lengths of at least 16
   octets MUST be supported.

   PSK identity MUST follow recommendations of Section 6.1 of [RFC9257].
   Implementations MUST support PSK identities of at least 16 octets.

   Although this document removes the option of obfuscation (Section 4),
   it is still possible that the TLS and non-TLS versions of TACACS+
   exist in an organization, for example, during migration
   (Section 6.1).  In such cases, the shared secrets configured for
   TACACS+ obfuscation clients MUST NOT be the same as the PSKs
   configured for TLS clients.

### 3.6. TLS Resumption

   TLS Resumption [RFC8446] can minimize the number of round trips
   required during the handshake process.  If a TLS client holds a
   ticket previously extracted from a NewSessionTicket message from the
   TLS TACACS+ server, it can use the PSK identity tied to that ticket.
   If the TLS TACACS+ server consents, the resumed session is
   acknowledged as authenticated and securely linked to the initial
   session.

   The client SHOULD use resumption when it holds a valid unused ticket
   from the TLS TACACS+ server, as each ticket is intended for a single
   use only and will be refreshed during resumption.  The TLS TACACS+
   server can reject a resumption request, but the TLS TACACS+ server
   SHOULD allow resumption if the ticket in question has not expired and
   has not been used before.

   When a TLS TACACS+ server is presented with a resumption request from
   the TLS client, it MAY still choose to require a full handshake.  In
   this case, the negotiation proceeds as if the session was a new
   authentication, and the resumption attempt is ignored.  As described
   in Appendix C.4 of [RFC8446], reuse of a ticket allows passive
   observers to correlate different connections.  TLS TACACS+ clients
   and servers SHOULD follow the client tracking preventions in Appendix C.4 of [RFC8446].

   When processing TLS resumption, certificates must be verified to
   check for revocation during the period since the last
   NewSessionTicket Message.

   The resumption ticket_lifetime SHOULD be configurable, including a
   zero seconds lifetime.  Refer to Section 4.6.1 of [RFC8446] for
   guidance on ticket lifetime.

## 4. Obsolescence of TACACS+ Obfuscation

   The obfuscation mechanism documented in Section 4.5 of [RFC8907] is
   weak.

   The introduction of TLS authentication and encryption to TACACS+
   replaces this former mechanism, so obfuscation is hereby obsoleted.
   This section describes how the TACACS+ client and servers MUST
   operate regarding the obfuscation mechanism.

   Peers MUST NOT use obfuscation with TLS.

   A TACACS+ client initiating a TACACS+ TLS connection MUST set the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG bit, thereby asserting that obfuscation is
   not used for the session.  All subsequent packets MUST have the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG bit set to 1.

   A TLS TACACS+ server that receives a packet with the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG bit not set to 1 over a TLS connection MUST
   return an error of TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_ERROR,
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR_STATUS_ERROR, or TAC_PLUS_ACCT_STATUS_ERROR as
   appropriate for the TACACS+ message type, with the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG bit set to 1, and terminate the session.
   This behavior corresponds to that defined in Section 4.5 of [RFC8907]   regarding data obfuscation for TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG or key
   mismatches.

   A TACACS+ client that receives a packet with the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG bit not set to 1 MUST terminate the
   session, and SHOULD log this error.

## 5. Security Considerations





### 5.1. TLS

   This document improves the confidentiality, integrity, and
   authentication of the connection and network traffic between TACACS+
   peers by adding TLS support.

   Simply adding TLS support to the protocol does not guarantee the
   protection of the TLS TACACS+ server and clients.  It is essential
   for the operators and equipment vendors to adhere to the latest best
   practices for ensuring the integrity of network devices and selecting
   secure TLS key and encryption algorithms.

   [BCP195] offers substantial guidance for implementing and deploying
   protocols that use TLS.  Those implementing and deploying Secure
   TACACS+ must adhere to the recommendations relevant to TLS 1.3
   outlined in [BCP195] or its subsequent versions.

   This document outlines additional restrictions permissible under
   [BCP195].  For example, any recommendations referring to TLS 1.2,
   including the mandatory support, are not relevant for Secure TACACS+,
   as TLS 1.3 or above is mandated.

   This document concerns the use of TLS as transport for TACACS+ and
   does not make any changes to the core TACACS+ protocol, other than
   the direct implications of deprecating obfuscation.  Operators MUST
   be cognizant of the security implications of the TACACS+ protocol
   itself.  Further documents are planned, for example, to address the
   security implications of password-based authentication and enhance
   the protocol to accommodate alternative schemes.

#### 5.1.1. TLS Use

   New TACACS+ production deployments SHOULD use TLS authentication and
   encryption.  Also see [RFC3365].

   TLS TACACS+ servers (as defined in Section 2) MUST NOT allow non-TLS
   connections, because of the threat of downgrade attacks or
   misconfiguration described in Section 5.3.  Instead, separate non-TLS
   TACACS+ servers SHOULD be set up to cater for these clients.

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED that TLS TACACS+ servers and non-TLS TACACS+
   servers be deployed on the same host, for reasons discussed in Section 5.3.  Non-TLS connections would be better served by deploying
   the required non-TLS TACACS+ servers on separate hosts.

   TACACS+ clients MUST NOT fail back to a non-TLS connection if a TLS
   connection fails.  This prohibition includes during the migration of
   a deployment (Section 6.1).

#### 5.1.2. TLS 0-RTT

   TLS 1.3 resumption and PSK techniques make it possible to send early
   data, aka 0-RTT data, data that is sent before the TLS handshake
   completes.  Replay of this data is a risk.  Given the sensitivity of
   TACACS+ data, clients MUST NOT send data until the full TLS handshake
   completes; that is, clients MUST NOT send 0-RTT data and TLS TACACS+
   servers MUST abruptly disconnect clients that do.

   TLS TACACS+ clients and servers MUST NOT include the "early_data"
   extension.  See Sections 2.3 and 4.2.10 of [RFC8446] for security
   concerns.

#### 5.1.3. TLS Options

   Recommendations in [BCP195] MUST be followed to determine which TLS
   versions and algorithms should be supported, deprecated, obsoleted,
   or abandoned.

   Also, Section 9 of [RFC8446] prescribes mandatory supported options.

#### 5.1.4. Unreachable Certificate Authority (CA)

   Operators should be cognizant of the potential of TLS TACACS+ server
   and/or client isolation from their peer's CA by network failures.
   Isolation from a public key certificate's CA will cause the
   verification of the certificate to fail and thus TLS authentication
   of the peer to fail.  The approach mentioned in Section 3.4.1 can
   help address this and should be considered.

#### 5.1.5. TLS Server Name Indicator (SNI)

   Operators should be aware that the TLS SNI extension is part of the
   TLS client hello, which is sent in cleartext.  It is, therefore,
   subject to eavesdropping.  Also see Section 11.1 of [RFC6066].

#### 5.1.6. Server Identity Wildcards

   The use of wildcards in TLS server identities creates a single point
   of failure: a compromised private key of a wildcard certificate
   impacts all servers using it.  Their use MUST follow the
   recommendations of Section 7.1 of [RFC9525].  Operators MUST ensure
   that the wildcard is limited to a subdomain dedicated solely to TLS
   TACACS+ servers.  Further, operators MUST ensure that the TLS TACACS+
   servers covered by a wildcard certificate are impervious to
   redirection of traffic to a different server (for example, due to on-
   path attacks or DNS cache poisoning).

### 5.2. TACACS+ Configuration

   Implementors must ensure that the configuration scheme introduced for
   enabling TLS is straightforward and leaves no room for ambiguity
   regarding whether TLS or non-TLS will be used between the TACACS+
   client and the TACACS+ server.

   This document recommends the use of a separate port number that TLS
   TACACS+ servers will listen to.  Where deployments have not
   overridden the defaults explicitly, TACACS+ client implementations
   MUST use the correct port values:

   *  49: for non-TLS connection TACACS+

   *  300: for TLS connection TACACS+

   Implementors may offer a single option for TACACS+ clients and
   servers to disable all non-TLS TACACS+ operations.  When enabled on a
   TACACS+ server, it will not respond to any requests from non-TLS
   TACACS+ client connections.  When enabled on a TACACS+ client, it
   will not establish any non-TLS TACACS+ server connections.

### 5.3. Well-Known TCP/IP Port Number

   A new port number is considered appropriate (rather than a mechanism
   that negotiates an upgrade from an initial non-TLS TACACS+
   connection) because it allows:

   *  ease of blocking the unobfuscated or obfuscated connections by the
      TCP/IP port number,

   *  passive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) monitoring the
      unobfuscated to be unaffected by the introduction of TLS,

   *  avoidance of on-path attacks that can interfere with upgrade, and

   *  prevention of the accidental exposure of sensitive information due
      to misconfiguration.

   However, the coexistence of inferior authentication and obfuscation,
   whether a non-TLS connection or deprecated parts that compose TLS,
   also presents an opportunity for downgrade attacks.  Causing failure
   of connections to the TLS-enabled service or the negotiation of
   shared algorithm support are two such downgrade attacks.

   The simplest mitigation exposure from non-TLS connection methods is
   to refuse non-TLS connections at the host entirely, perhaps using
   separate hosts for non-TLS connections and TLS.

   Another approach is mutual configuration that requires TLS.  TACACS+
   clients and servers SHOULD support configuration that requires peers,
   globally and individually, to use TLS.  Furthermore, peers SHOULD be
   configurable to limit offered or recognized TLS versions and
   algorithms to those recommended by standards bodies and implementers.

## 6. Operational Considerations

   Operational and deployment considerations are spread throughout the
   document.  While avoiding repetition, it is useful for the impatient
   to direct particular attention to Sections 5.2 and 5.1.5.  However,
   it is important that the entire Section 5 is observed.

   It is essential for operators to understand the implications of a TLS
   certificate-based authentication solution, including the correct
   handling of certificates, CAs, and all elements of TLS configuration.
   Refer to [BCP195] for guidance.  Attention is drawn to the
   provisioning of certificates to all peers, including TACACS+ TLS
   clients, to permit the mandatory mutual authentication.

### 6.1. Migration



   Section 5.2 mentions that for an optimal deployment of TLS TACACS+,
   TLS should be universally applied throughout the deployment.
   However, during the migration process from a non-TLS TACACS+
   deployment, operators may need to support both TLS and non-TLS
   TACACS+ servers.  This migration phase allows operators to gradually
   transition their deployments from an insecure state to a more secure
   one, but it is important to note that it is vulnerable to downgrade
   attacks.  Therefore, the migration phase should be considered
   insecure until it is fully completed.  To mitigate this hazard:

   *  The period where any client is configured with both TLS and non-
      TLS TACACS+ servers should be minimized.

   *  The operator must consider the security impact of supporting both
      TLS and non-TLS connections, as mentioned above.

### 6.2. Maintaining Non-TLS TACACS+ Clients

   Some TACACS+ client devices in a deployment may not implement TLS.
   These devices will require access to non-TLS TACACS+ servers.
   Operators must follow the recommendation of Section 5.1.1 and deploy
   separate non-TLS TACACS+ servers for these non-TLS clients from those
   used for the TLS clients.

### 6.3. YANG Model for TACACS+ Clients

   [TACACS-YANG ] specifies a YANG model for managing TACACS+ clients,
   including TLS support.

## 7. IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated the following new well-known system in the
   "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" (see
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers >).  The
   service name "tacacss" follows the common practice of appending an
   "s" to the name given to the non-TLS well-known port name.  See the
   justification for the allocation in Section 5.3.

   Service Name:  tacacss
   Port Number:  300
   Transport Protocol:  TCP
   Description:  TLS Secure Login Host Protocol (TACACSS)
   Assignee:  IESG
   Contact:  IETF Chair
   Reference:  RFC 9887   Considerations about service discovery are out of scope of this
   document.

# Referenced Sections from RFC 8907: The Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) Protocol

The following sections were referenced. Remaining sections are not included.

## 1. Introduction

   This document describes the Terminal Access Controller Access-Control
   System Plus (TACACS+) protocol.  It was conceived initially as a
   general Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocol.
   It is widely deployed today but is mainly confined for a specific
   subset of AAA called Device Administration, which includes
   authenticating access to network devices, providing central
   authorization of operations, and auditing of those operations.

   A wide range of TACACS+ clients and servers is already deployed in
   the field.  The TACACS+ protocol they are based on is defined in a
   document that was originally intended for IETF publication, but was
   never standardized.  The document is known as "The Draft"
   [THE-DRAFT ].

   This Draft was a product of its time and did not address all of the
   key security concerns that are considered when designing modern
   standards.  Therefore, deployment must be executed with care.  These
   concerns are addressed in Section 10.

   The primary intent of this informational document is to clarify the
   subset of "The Draft", which is common to implementations supporting
   Device Administration.  It is intended that all implementations that
   conform to this document will conform to "The Draft".  However, it is
   not intended that all implementations that conform to "The Draft"
   will conform to this document.  The following features from "The
   Draft" have been removed:

   *  This document officially removes SENDPASS for security reasons.

   *  The normative description of legacy features such as the Apple
      Remote Access Protocol (ARAP) and outbound authentication has been
      removed.

   *  The Support for forwarding to an alternative daemon
      (TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FOLLOW) has been deprecated.

   The TACACS+ protocol allows for arbitrary length and content
   authentication exchanges to support alternative authentication
   mechanisms.  It is extensible to provide for site customization and
   future development features, and it uses TCP to ensure reliable
   delivery.  The protocol allows the TACACS+ client to request fine-
   grained access control and allows the server to respond to each
   component of that request.

   The separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting is a
   key element of the design of TACACS+ protocol.  Essentially, it makes
   TACACS+ a suite of three protocols.  This document will address each
   one in separate sections.  Although TACACS+ defines all three, an
   implementation or deployment is not required to employ all three.
   Separating the elements is useful for the Device Administration use
   case, specifically, for authorization and accounting of individual
   commands in a session.  Note that there is no provision made at the
   protocol level to associate authentication requests with
   authorization requests.

## 3. Technical Definitions

   This section provides a few basic definitions that are applicable to
   this document.

### 3.1. Client

   The client is any device that initiates TACACS+ protocol requests to
   mediate access, mainly for the Device Administration use case.

### 3.2. Server

   The server receives TACACS+ protocol requests and replies according
   to its business model in accordance with the flows defined in this
   document.

### 3.3. Packet

   All uses of the word packet in this document refer to TACACS+
   protocol data units unless explicitly noted otherwise.  The informal
   term "packet" has become an established part of the definition.

### 3.4. Connection

   TACACS+ uses TCP for its transport.  TCP Server port 49 is allocated
   by IANA for TACACS+ traffic.

### 3.5. Session

   The concept of a session is used throughout this document.  A TACACS+
   session is a single authentication sequence, a single authorization
   exchange, or a single accounting exchange.

   An accounting and authorization session will consist of a single pair
   of packets (the request and its reply).  An authentication session
   may involve an arbitrary number of packets being exchanged.  The
   session is an operational concept that is maintained between the
   TACACS+ client and server.  It does not necessarily correspond to a
   given user or user action.

### 3.6. Treatment of Enumerated Protocol Values

   This document describes various enumerated values in the packet
   header and the headers for specific packet types.  For example, in
   the authentication start packet type, this document defines the
   action field with three values: TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN,
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_CHPASS, and TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SENDAUTH.

   If the server does not implement one of the defined options in a
   packet that it receives, or it encounters an option that is not
   listed in this document for a header field, then it should respond
   with an ERROR and terminate the session.  This will allow the client
   to try a different option.

   If an error occurs but the type of the incoming packet cannot be
   determined, a packet with the identical cleartext header but with a
   sequence number incremented by one and the length set to zero MUST be
   returned to indicate an error.

### 3.7. Treatment of Text Strings

   The TACACS+ protocol makes extensive use of text strings.  "The
   Draft" intended that these strings would be treated as byte arrays
   where each byte would represent a US-ASCII character.

   More recently, server implementations have been extended to interwork
   with external identity services, and so a more nuanced approach is
   needed.  Usernames MUST be encoded and handled using the
   UsernameCasePreserved Profile specified in [RFC8265].  The security
   considerations in Section 8 of [RFC8265] apply.

   Where specifically mentioned, data fields contain arrays of arbitrary
   bytes as required for protocol processing.  These are not intended to
   be made visible through user interface to users.

   All other text fields in TACACS+ MUST be treated as printable byte
   arrays of US-ASCII as defined by [RFC0020].  The term "printable"
   used here means the fields MUST exclude the "Control Characters"
   defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC0020].

## 4. TACACS+ Packets and Sessions





### 4.1. The TACACS+ Packet Header

   All TACACS+ packets begin with the following 12-byte header.  The
   header describes the remainder of the packet:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |major  | minor  |                |                |                |
   |version| version|      type      |     seq_no     |   flags        |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |                                                                   |
   |                            session_id                             |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |                                                                   |
   |                              length                               |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   The following general rules apply to all TACACS+ packet types:

   *  To signal that any variable-length data fields are unused, the
      corresponding length values are set to zero.  Such fields MUST be
      ignored, and treated as if not present.

   *  The lengths of data and message fields in a packet are specified
      by their corresponding length field (and are not null terminated).

   *  All length values are unsigned and in network byte order.

   major_version

      This is the major TACACS+ version number.

      TAC_PLUS_MAJOR_VER := 0xc

   minor_version

      This is the minor TACACS+ version number.

      TAC_PLUS_MINOR_VER_DEFAULT := 0x0

      TAC_PLUS_MINOR_VER_ONE := 0x1

   type

      This is the packet type.

      Options are:

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN := 0x01 (Authentication)

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHOR := 0x02 (Authorization)

      TAC_PLUS_ACCT := 0x03 (Accounting)

   seq_no

      This is the sequence number of the current packet.  The first
      packet in a session MUST have the sequence number 1, and each
      subsequent packet will increment the sequence number by one.
      TACACS+ clients only send packets containing odd sequence numbers,
      and TACACS+ servers only send packets containing even sequence
      numbers.

      The sequence number must never wrap, i.e., if the sequence number
      2^(8)-1 is ever reached, that session must terminate and be
      restarted with a sequence number of 1.

   flags

      This field contains various bitmapped flags.

      The flag bit:

      TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG := 0x01

      This flag indicates that the sender did not obfuscate the body of
      the packet.  This option MUST NOT be used in production.  The
      application of this flag will be covered in "Security
      Considerations" (Section 10).

      This flag SHOULD be clear in all deployments.  Modern network
      traffic tools support encrypted traffic when configured with the
      shared secret (see "Shared Secrets" (Section 10.5.1)), so
      obfuscated mode can and SHOULD be used even during test.

      The single-connection flag:

      TAC_PLUS_SINGLE_CONNECT_FLAG := 0x04

      This flag is used to allow a client and server to negotiate
      "Single Connection Mode" (Section 4.3).

      All other bits MUST be ignored when reading, and SHOULD be set to
      zero when writing.

   session_id

      The Id for this TACACS+ session.  This field does not change for
      the duration of the TACACS+ session.  This number MUST be
      generated by a cryptographically strong random number generation
      method.  Failure to do so will compromise security of the session.
      For more details, refer to [RFC4086].

   length

      The total length of the packet body (not including the header).
      Implementations MUST allow control over maximum packet sizes
      accepted by TACACS+ Servers.  The recommended maximum packet size
      is 2^(16).

### 4.2. The TACACS+ Packet Body

   The TACACS+ body types are defined in the packet header.  The next
   sections of this document will address the contents of the different
   TACACS+ bodies.

### 4.3. Single Connection Mode

   Single Connection Mode is intended to improve performance where there
   is a lot of traffic between a client and a server by allowing the
   client to multiplex multiple sessions on a single TCP connection.

   The packet header contains the TAC_PLUS_SINGLE_CONNECT_FLAG used by
   the client and server to negotiate the use of Single Connection Mode.

   The client sets this flag to indicate that it supports multiplexing
   TACACS+ sessions over a single TCP connection.  The client MUST NOT
   send a second packet on a connection until single-connect status has
   been established.

   To indicate it will support Single Connection Mode, the server sets
   this flag in the first reply packet in response to the first request
   from a client.  The server may set this flag even if the client does
   not set it, but the client may ignore the flag and close the
   connection after the session completes.

   The flag is only relevant for the first two packets on a connection,
   to allow the client and server to establish Single Connection Mode.
   No provision is made for changing Single Connection Mode after the
   first two packets; the client and server MUST ignore the flag after
   the second packet on a connection.

   If Single Connection Mode has not been established in the first two
   packets of a TCP connection, then both the client and the server
   close the connection at the end of the first session.

   The client negotiates Single Connection Mode to improve efficiency.
   The server may refuse to allow Single Connection Mode for the client.
   For example, it may not be appropriate to allocate a long-lasting TCP
   connection to a specific client in some deployments.  Even if the
   server is configured to permit Single Connection Mode for a specific
   client, the server may close the connection.  For example, a server
   MUST be configured to time out a Single Connection Mode TCP
   connection after a specific period of inactivity to preserve its
   resources.  The client MUST accommodate such closures on a TCP
   session even after Single Connection Mode has been established.

   The TCP connection underlying the Single Connection Mode will close
   eventually either because of the timeout from the server or from an
   intermediate link.  If a session is in progress when the client
   detects disconnect, then the client should handle it as described in
   "Session Completion" (Section 4.4).  If a session is not in progress,
   then the client will need to detect this and restart the Single
   Connection Mode when it initiates the next session.

### 4.4. Session Completion

   The REPLY packets defined for the packet types in the sections below
   (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) contain a status
   field.  The complete set of options for this field depend upon the
   packet type, but all three REPLY packet types define values
   representing PASS, ERROR, and FAIL, which indicate the last packet of
   a regular session (one that is not aborted).

   The server responds with a PASS or a FAIL to indicate that the
   processing of the request completed and that the client can apply the
   result (PASS or FAIL) to control the execution of the action that
   prompted the request to be sent to the server.

   The server responds with an ERROR to indicate that the processing of
   the request did not complete.  The client cannot apply the result,
   and it MUST behave as if the server could not be connected to.  For
   example, the client tries alternative methods, if they are available,
   such as sending the request to a backup server or using local
   configuration to determine whether the action that prompted the
   request should be executed.

   Refer to "Aborting an Authentication Session" (Section 5.4.3) for
   details on handling additional status options.

   When the session is complete, the TCP connection should be handled as
   follows, according to whether Single Connection Mode was negotiated:

   *  If Single Connection Mode was not negotiated, then the connection
      should be closed.

   *  If Single Connection Mode was enabled, then the connection SHOULD
      be left open (see "Single Connection Mode" (Section 4.3)) but may
      still be closed after a timeout period to preserve deployment
      resources.

   *  If Single Connection Mode was enabled, but an ERROR occurred due
      to connection issues (such as an incorrect secret (see Section 4.5)), then any further new sessions MUST NOT be accepted
      on the connection.  If there are any sessions that have already
      been established, then they MAY be completed.  Once all active
      sessions are completed, then the connection MUST be closed.

   It is recommended that client implementations provide robust schemes
   for dealing with servers that cannot be connected to.  Options
   include providing a list of servers for redundancy and an option for
   a local fallback configuration if no servers can be reached.  Details
   will be implementation specific.

   The client should manage connections and handle the case of a server
   that establishes a connection but does not respond.  The exact
   behavior is implementation specific.  It is recommended that the
   client close the connection after a configurable timeout.

### 4.5. Data Obfuscation

   The body of packets may be obfuscated.  The following sections
   describe the obfuscation method that is supported in the protocol.
   In "The Draft", this process was actually referred to as Encryption,
   but the algorithm would not meet modern standards and so will not be
   termed as encryption in this document.

   The obfuscation mechanism relies on a secret key, a shared secret
   value that is known to both the client and the server.  The secret
   keys MUST remain secret.

   Server implementations MUST allow a unique secret key to be
   associated with each client.  It is a site-dependent decision as to
   whether or not the use of separate keys is appropriate.

   The flag field MUST be configured with TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG set
   to 0 so that the packet body is obfuscated by XORing it bytewise with
   a pseudo-random pad:

      ENCRYPTED {data} = data ^(pseudo_pad)

   The packet body can then be de-obfuscated by XORing it bytewise with
   a pseudo-random pad.

      data = ENCRYPTED {data} ^(pseudo_pad)

   The pad is generated by concatenating a series of MD5 hashes (each 16
   bytes long) and truncating it to the length of the input data.
   Whenever used in this document, MD5 refers to the "RSA Data Security,
   Inc.  MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" as specified in [RFC1321].

      pseudo_pad = {MD5_1 [,MD5_2 [ ... ,MD5_n]]} truncated to len(data)

   The first MD5 hash is generated by concatenating the session_id, the
   secret key, the version number, and the sequence number, and then
   running MD5 over that stream.  All of those input values are
   available in the packet header, except for the secret key, which is a
   shared secret between the TACACS+ client and server.

   The version number and session_id are extracted from the header.

   Subsequent hashes are generated by using the same input stream but
   concatenating the previous hash value at the end of the input stream.

      MD5_1 = MD5{session_id, key, version, seq_no} MD5_2 =
      MD5{session_id, key, version, seq_no, MD5_1} ....  MD5_n =
      MD5{session_id, key, version, seq_no, MD5_n-1}

   When a server detects that the secrets it has configured for the
   device do not match, it MUST return ERROR.  For details of TCP
   connection handling on ERROR, refer to "Session Completion"
   (Section 4.4).

      TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG == 0x1

   This option is deprecated and MUST NOT be used in production.  In
   this case, the entire packet body is in cleartext.  A request MUST be
   dropped if TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG is set to true.

   After a packet body is de-obfuscated, the lengths of the component
   values in the packet are summed.  If the sum is not identical to the
   cleartext datalength value from the header, the packet MUST be
   discarded and an ERROR signaled.  For details of TCP connection
   handling on ERROR, refer to "Session Completion" (Section 4.4).

   Commonly, such failures are seen when the keys are mismatched between
   the client and the TACACS+ server.

## 5. Authentication

   Authentication is the action of determining who a user (or entity)
   is.  Authentication can take many forms.  Traditional authentication
   employs a name and a fixed password.  However, fixed passwords are
   vulnerable security, so many modern authentication mechanisms utilize
   "one-time" passwords or a challenge-response query.  TACACS+ is
   designed to support all of these and be flexible enough to handle any
   future mechanisms.  Authentication generally takes place when the
   user first logs in to a machine or requests a service of it.

   Authentication is not mandatory; it is a site-configured option.
   Some sites do not require it.  Others require it only for certain
   services (see "Authorization" (Section 6)).  Authentication may also
   take place when a user attempts to gain extra privileges and must
   identify himself or herself as someone who possesses the required
   information (passwords, etc.) for those privileges.

### 5.1. The Authentication START Packet Body

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |    action      |    priv_lvl    |  authen_type   | authen_service |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |    user_len    |    port_len    |  rem_addr_len  |    data_len    |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |    user ...
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |    rem_addr ...
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |    data...
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   Packet fields are as follows:

   action

      This indicates the authentication action.

      Valid values are:

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN := 0x01

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_CHPASS := 0x02

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SENDAUTH := 0x04

   priv_lvl

      This indicates the privilege level that the user is authenticating
      as.  Please refer to "Privilege Levels" (Section 9).

   authen_type

      The type of authentication.  Please see "Common Authentication
      Flows" (Section 5.4.2).

      Valid values are:

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_ASCII := 0x01

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_PAP := 0x02

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_CHAP := 0x03

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_MSCHAP := 0x05

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_MSCHAPV2 := 0x06

   authen_service

      This is the service that is requesting the authentication.

      Valid values are:

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_NONE := 0x00

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_LOGIN := 0x01

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_ENABLE := 0x02

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_PPP := 0x03

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_PT := 0x05

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_RCMD := 0x06

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_X25 := 0x07

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_NASI := 0x08

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_FWPROXY := 0x09

      The TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_NONE option is intended for the
      authorization application of this field that indicates that no
      authentication was performed by the device.

      The TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_LOGIN option indicates regular login (as
      opposed to ENABLE) to a client device.

      The TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_ENABLE option identifies the ENABLE
      authen_service, which refers to a service requesting
      authentication in order to grant the user different privileges.
      This is comparable to the Unix "su(1)" command, which substitutes
      the current user's identity with another.  An authen_service value
      of NONE is only to be used when none of the other authen_service
      values are appropriate.  ENABLE may be requested independently; no
      requirements for previous authentications or authorizations are
      imposed by the protocol.

      Other options are included for legacy/backwards compatibility.

   user, user_len

      The username is optional in this packet, depending upon the class
      of authentication.  If it is absent, the client MUST set user_len
      to 0.  If included, the user_len indicates the length of the user
      field, in bytes.

   port, port_len

      The name of the client port on which the authentication is taking
      place.  The value of this field is free-format text and is client
      specific.  Examples of this argument include "tty10" to denote the
      tenth tty line, and "async10" to denote the tenth async interface.
      The client documentation SHOULD define the values and their
      meanings for this field.  For details of text encoding, see
      "Treatment of Text Strings" (Section 3.7).  The port_len indicates
      the length of the port field, in bytes.

   rem_addr, rem_addr_len

      A string indicating the remote location from which the user has
      connected to the client.  For details of text encoding, see
      "Treatment of Text Strings" (Section 3.7).

      When TACACS+ was used for dial-up services, this value contained
      the caller ID.

      When TACACS+ is used for Device Administration, the user is
      normally connected via a network, and in this case, the value is
      intended to hold a network address, IPv4 or IPv6.  For IPv6
      address text representation defined, please see [RFC5952].

      This field is optional (since the information may not be
      available).  The rem_addr_len indicates the length of the user
      field, in bytes.

   data, data_len

      The data field is used to send data appropriate for the action and
      authen_type.  It is described in more detail in "Common
      Authentication Flows" (Section 5.4.2).  The data_len field
      indicates the length of the data field, in bytes.

### 5.2. The Authentication REPLY Packet Body

   The TACACS+ server sends only one type of authentication packet (a
   REPLY packet) to the client.

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |     status     |      flags     |        server_msg_len           |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |           data_len              |        server_msg ...
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |           data ...
   +----------------+----------------+

   status

      The current status of the authentication.

      Valid values are:

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_PASS := 0x01

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FAIL := 0x02

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETDATA := 0x03

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETUSER := 0x04

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETPASS := 0x05

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_RESTART := 0x06

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_ERROR := 0x07

      TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FOLLOW := 0x21

   flags

      Bitmapped flags that modify the action to be taken.

      The following values are defined:

      TAC_PLUS_REPLY_FLAG_NOECHO := 0x01

   server_msg, server_msg_len

      A message to be displayed to the user.  This field is optional.
      The server_msg_len indicates the length of the server_msg field,
      in bytes.  For details of text encoding, see "Treatment of Text
      Strings" (Section 3.7).

   data, data_len

      A field that holds data that is a part of the authentication
      exchange and is intended for client processing, not the user.  It
      is not a printable text encoding.  Examples of its use are shown
      in "Common Authentication Flows" (Section 5.4.2).  The data_len
      indicates the length of the data field, in bytes.

### 5.3. The Authentication CONTINUE Packet Body

   This packet is sent from the client to the server following the
   receipt of a REPLY packet.

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |          user_msg len           |            data_len             |
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |     flags      |  user_msg ...
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |    data ...
   +----------------+

   user_msg, user_msg_len

      A field that is the string that the user entered, or the client
      provided on behalf of the user, in response to the server_msg from
      a REPLY packet.  The user_len indicates the length of the user
      field, in bytes.

   data, data_len

      This field carries information that is specific to the action and
      the authen_type for this session.  Valid uses of this field are
      described below.  It is not a printable text encoding.  The
      data_len indicates the length of the data field, in bytes.

   flags

      This holds the bitmapped flags that modify the action to be taken.

      The following values are defined:

      TAC_PLUS_CONTINUE_FLAG_ABORT := 0x01

### 5.4. Description of Authentication Process

   The action, authen_type, and authen_service fields (described above)
   combine to indicate what kind of authentication is to be performed.
   Every authentication START, REPLY, and CONTINUE packet includes a
   data field.  The use of this field is dependent upon the kind of
   authentication.

   This document defines a core set of authentication flows to be
   supported by TACACS+.  Each authentication flow consists of a START
   packet.  The server responds either with a request for more
   information (GETDATA, GETUSER, or GETPASS) or a termination PASS,
   FAIL, ERROR, or RESTART.  The actions and meanings when the server
   sends a RESTART or ERROR are common and are described further below.

   When the REPLY status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETDATA,
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETUSER, or TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETPASS,
   authentication continues and the server SHOULD provide server_msg
   content for the client to prompt the user for more information.  The
   client MUST then return a CONTINUE packet containing the requested
   information in the user_msg field.

   The client should interpret TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETUSER as a
   request for a username and TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETPASS as a
   request for a password.  The TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETDATA is the
   generic request for more information to flexibly support future
   requirements.

   If the information being requested by the server from the client is
   sensitive, then the server should set the TAC_PLUS_REPLY_FLAG_NOECHO
   flag.  When the client queries the user for the information, the
   response MUST NOT be reflected in the user interface as it is
   entered.

   The data field is only used in the REPLY where explicitly defined
   below.

#### 5.4.1. Version Behavior

   The TACACS+ protocol is versioned to allow revisions while
   maintaining backwards compatibility.  The version number is in every
   packet header.  The changes between minor_version 0 and 1 apply only
   to the authentication process, and all deal with the way that
   Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and Password
   Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentications are handled.
   minor_version 1 may only be used for authentication kinds that
   explicitly call for it in the table below:

                +-------------+-------+--------+----------+
                |             | LOGIN | CHPASS | SENDAUTH |
                +-------------+-------+--------+----------+
                | ASCII       | v0    | v0     | -        |
                +-------------+-------+--------+----------+
                | PAP         | v1    | -      | v1       |
                +-------------+-------+--------+----------+
                | CHAP        | v1    | -      | v1       |
                +-------------+-------+--------+----------+
                | MS-CHAPv1/2 | v1    | -      | v1       |
                +-------------+-------+--------+----------+

                    Table 1: TACACS+ Protocol Versioning

   The '-' symbol represents that the option is not valid.

   All authorization and accounting and ASCII authentication use
   minor_version 0.

   PAP, CHAP, and MS-CHAP login use minor_version 1.  The normal
   exchange is a single START packet from the client and a single REPLY
   from the server.

   The removal of SENDPASS was prompted by security concerns and is no
   longer considered part of the TACACS+ protocol.

#### 5.4.2. Common Authentication Flows

   This section describes common authentication flows.  If the server
   does not implement an option, it MUST respond with
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FAIL.

##### 5.4.2.1. ASCII Login

       action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN
       authen_type = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_ASCII
       minor_version = 0x0

   This is a standard ASCII authentication.  The START packet MAY
   contain the username.  If the user does not include the username,
   then the server MUST obtain it from the client with a CONTINUE
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETUSER.  If the user does not provide a
   username, then the server can send another
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETUSER request, but the server MUST limit the
   number of retries that are permitted; the recommended limit is three
   attempts.  When the server has the username, it will obtain the
   password using a continue with TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETPASS.  ASCII
   login uses the user_msg field for both the username and password.
   The data fields in both the START and CONTINUE packets are not used
   for ASCII logins; any content MUST be ignored.  The session is
   composed of a single START followed by zero or more pairs of REPLYs
   and CONTINUEs, followed by a final REPLY indicating PASS, FAIL, or
   ERROR.

##### 5.4.2.2. PAP Login

       action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN
       authen_type = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_PAP
       minor_version = 0x1

   The entire exchange MUST consist of a single START packet and a
   single REPLY.  The START packet MUST contain a username and the data
   field MUST contain the PAP ASCII password.  A PAP authentication only
   consists of a username and password [RFC1334] (Obsolete).  The REPLY
   from the server MUST be either a PASS, FAIL, or ERROR.

##### 5.4.2.3. CHAP Login

       action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN
       authen_type = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_CHAP
       minor_version = 0x1

   The entire exchange MUST consist of a single START packet and a
   single REPLY.  The START packet MUST contain the username in the user
   field, and the data field is a concatenation of the PPP id, the
   challenge, and the response.

   The length of the challenge value can be determined from the length
   of the data field minus the length of the id (always 1 octet) and the
   length of the response field (always 16 octets).

   To perform the authentication, the server calculates the PPP hash as
   defined in PPP Authentication [RFC1334] and then compares that value
   with the response.  The MD5 algorithm option is always used.  The
   REPLY from the server MUST be a PASS, FAIL, or ERROR.

   The selection of the challenge and its length are not an aspect of
   the TACACS+ protocol.  However, it is strongly recommended that the
   client/endstation interaction be configured with a secure challenge.
   The TACACS+ server can help by rejecting authentications where the
   challenge is below a minimum length (minimum recommended is 8 bytes).

##### 5.4.2.4. MS-CHAP v1 Login

       action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN
       authen_type = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_MSCHAP
       minor_version = 0x1

   The entire exchange MUST consist of a single START packet and a
   single REPLY.  The START packet MUST contain the username in the user
   field, and the data field will be a concatenation of the PPP id, the
   MS-CHAP challenge, and the MS-CHAP response.

   The length of the challenge value can be determined from the length
   of the data field minus the length of the id (always 1 octet) and the
   length of the response field (always 49 octets).

   To perform the authentication, the server will use a combination of
   MD4 and DES on the user's secret and the challenge, as defined in
   [RFC2433], and then compare the resulting value with the response.
   The REPLY from the server MUST be a PASS or FAIL.

   For best practices, please refer to [RFC2433].  The TACACS+ server
   MUST reject authentications where the challenge deviates from 8 bytes
   as defined in the RFC.

##### 5.4.2.5. MS-CHAP v2 Login

       action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN
       authen_type = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_MSCHAPV2
       minor_version = 0x1

   The entire exchange MUST consist of a single START packet and a
   single REPLY.  The START packet MUST contain the username in the user
   field, and the data field will be a concatenation of the PPP id, the
   MS-CHAP challenge, and the MS-CHAP response.

   The length of the challenge value can be determined from the length
   of the data field minus the length of the id (always 1 octet) and the
   length of the response field (always 49 octets).

   To perform the authentication, the server will use the algorithm
   specified [RFC2759] on the user's secret and challenge, and then
   compare the resulting value with the response.  The REPLY from the
   server MUST be a PASS or FAIL.

   For best practices for MS-CHAP v2, please refer to [RFC2759].  The
   TACACS+ server MUST reject authentications where the challenge
   deviates from 16 bytes as defined in the RFC.

##### 5.4.2.6. Enable Requests

       action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_LOGIN
       priv_lvl = implementation dependent
       authen_type = not used
       service = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_ENABLE

   This is an "ENABLE" request, used to change the current running
   privilege level of a user.  The exchange MAY consist of multiple
   messages while the server collects the information it requires in
   order to allow changing the principal's privilege level.  This
   exchange is very similar to an ASCII login (Section 5.4.2.1).

   In order to readily distinguish "ENABLE" requests from other types of
   request, the value of the authen_service field MUST be set to
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_SVC_ENABLE when requesting an ENABLE.  It MUST NOT be
   set to this value when requesting any other operation.

##### 5.4.2.7. ASCII Change Password Request

   action = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_CHPASS
   authen_type = TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_ASCII

   This exchange consists of multiple messages while the server collects
   the information it requires in order to change the user's password.
   It is very similar to an ASCII login.  The status value
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETPASS MUST only be used when requesting the
   "new" password.  It MAY be sent multiple times.  When requesting the
   "old" password, the status value MUST be set to
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_GETDATA.

#### 5.4.3. Aborting an Authentication Session

   The client may prematurely terminate a session by setting the
   TAC_PLUS_CONTINUE_FLAG_ABORT flag in the CONTINUE message.  If this
   flag is set, the data portion of the message may contain a text
   explaining the reason for the abort.  This text will be handled by
   the server according to the requirements of the deployment.  For
   details of text encoding, see "Treatment of Text Strings"
   (Section 3.7).  For more details about session termination, refer to
   "Session Completion" (Section 4.4).

   In cases of PASS, FAIL, or ERROR, the server can insert a message
   into server_msg to be displayed to the user.

   "The Draft" [THE-DRAFT ] defined a mechanism to direct authentication
   requests to an alternative server.  This mechanism is regarded as
   insecure, is deprecated, and is not covered here.  The client should
   treat TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FOLLOW as TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FAIL.

   If the status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_ERROR, then the host is
   indicating that it is experiencing an unrecoverable error and the
   authentication will proceed as if that host could not be contacted.
   The data field may contain a message to be printed on an
   administrative console or log.

   If the status equals TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_RESTART, then the
   authentication sequence is restarted with a new START packet from the
   client, with a new session Id and seq_no set to 1.  This REPLY packet
   indicates that the current authen_type value (as specified in the
   START packet) is not acceptable for this session.  The client may try
   an alternative authen_type.

   If a client does not implement the TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_RESTART
   option, then it MUST process the response as if the status was
   TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_STATUS_FAIL.

# Referenced Sections from RFC 8446: The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3

The following sections were referenced. Remaining sections are not included.

## 1. Introduction

   The primary goal of TLS is to provide a secure channel between two
   communicating peers; the only requirement from the underlying
   transport is a reliable, in-order data stream.  Specifically, the
   secure channel should provide the following properties:

   -  Authentication: The server side of the channel is always
      authenticated; the client side is optionally authenticated.
      Authentication can happen via asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA
      [RSA ], the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
      [ECDSA ], or the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
      [RFC8032]) or a symmetric pre-shared key (PSK).

   -  Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel after establishment is
      only visible to the endpoints.  TLS does not hide the length of
      the data it transmits, though endpoints are able to pad TLS
      records in order to obscure lengths and improve protection against
      traffic analysis techniques.

   -  Integrity: Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot
      be modified by attackers without detection.

   These properties should be true even in the face of an attacker who
   has complete control of the network, as described in [RFC3552].  See Appendix E  for a more complete statement of the relevant security
   properties.

   TLS consists of two primary components:

   -  A handshake protocol (Section 4) that authenticates the
      communicating parties, negotiates cryptographic modes and
      parameters, and establishes shared keying material.  The handshake
      protocol is designed to resist tampering; an active attacker
      should not be able to force the peers to negotiate different
      parameters than they would if the connection were not under
      attack.

   -  A record protocol (Section 5) that uses the parameters established
      by the handshake protocol to protect traffic between the
      communicating peers.  The record protocol divides traffic up into
      a series of records, each of which is independently protected
      using the traffic keys. 
   TLS is application protocol independent; higher-level protocols can
   layer on top of TLS transparently.  The TLS standard, however, does
   not specify how protocols add security with TLS; how to initiate TLS
   handshaking and how to interpret the authentication certificates
   exchanged are left to the judgment of the designers and implementors
   of protocols that run on top of TLS.

   This document defines TLS version 1.3.  While TLS 1.3 is not directly
   compatible with previous versions, all versions of TLS incorporate a
   versioning mechanism which allows clients and servers to
   interoperably negotiate a common version if one is supported by both
   peers.

   This document supersedes and obsoletes previous versions of TLS,
   including version 1.2 [RFC5246].  It also obsoletes the TLS ticket
   mechanism defined in [RFC5077] and replaces it with the mechanism
   defined in Section 2.2.  Because TLS 1.3 changes the way keys are
   derived, it updates [RFC5705] as described in Section 7.5.  It also
   changes how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) messages are
   carried and therefore updates [RFC6066] and obsoletes [RFC6961] as
   described in Section 4.4.2.1.

### 1.1. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used:

   client:  The endpoint initiating the TLS connection.

   connection:  A transport-layer connection between two endpoints.

   endpoint:  Either the client or server of the connection.

   handshake:  An initial negotiation between client and server that
      establishes the parameters of their subsequent interactions
      within TLS.

   peer:  An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer"
      refers to the endpoint that is not the primary subject of
      discussion. 
   receiver:  An endpoint that is receiving records.

   sender:  An endpoint that is transmitting records.

   server:  The endpoint that did not initiate the TLS connection.

### 1.2. Major Differences from TLS 1.2

   The following is a list of the major functional differences between
   TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.  It is not intended to be exhaustive, and there
   are many minor differences.

   -  The list of supported symmetric encryption algorithms has been
      pruned of all algorithms that are considered legacy.  Those that
      remain are all Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
      (AEAD) algorithms.  The cipher suite concept has been changed to
      separate the authentication and key exchange mechanisms from the
      record protection algorithm (including secret key length) and a
      hash to be used with both the key derivation function and
      handshake message authentication code (MAC).

   -  A zero round-trip time (0-RTT) mode was added, saving a round trip
      at connection setup for some application data, at the cost of
      certain security properties.

   -  Static RSA and Diffie-Hellman cipher suites have been removed; all
      public-key based key exchange mechanisms now provide forward
      secrecy.

   -  All handshake messages after the ServerHello are now encrypted.
      The newly introduced EncryptedExtensions message allows various
      extensions previously sent in the clear in the ServerHello to also
      enjoy confidentiality protection.

   -  The key derivation functions have been redesigned.  The new design
      allows easier analysis by cryptographers due to their improved key
      separation properties.  The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key
      Derivation Function (HKDF) is used as an underlying primitive.

   -  The handshake state machine has been significantly restructured to
      be more consistent and to remove superfluous messages such as
      ChangeCipherSpec (except when needed for middlebox compatibility).

   -  Elliptic curve algorithms are now in the base spec, and new
      signature algorithms, such as EdDSA, are included.  TLS 1.3
      removed point format negotiation in favor of a single point format
      for each curve. 
   -  Other cryptographic improvements were made, including changing the
      RSA padding to use the RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme
      (RSASSA-PSS), and the removal of compression, the Digital
      Signature Algorithm (DSA), and custom Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
      (DHE) groups.

   -  The TLS 1.2 version negotiation mechanism has been deprecated in
      favor of a version list in an extension.  This increases
      compatibility with existing servers that incorrectly implemented
      version negotiation.

   -  Session resumption with and without server-side state as well as
      the PSK-based cipher suites of earlier TLS versions have been
      replaced by a single new PSK exchange.

   -  References have been updated to point to the updated versions of
      RFCs, as appropriate (e.g., RFC 5280 rather than RFC 3280).

### 1.3. Updates Affecting TLS 1.2

   This document defines several changes that optionally affect
   implementations of TLS 1.2, including those which do not also support
   TLS 1.3:

   -  A version downgrade protection mechanism is described in Section 4.1.3.

   -  RSASSA-PSS signature schemes are defined in Section 4.2.3.

   -  The "supported_versions" ClientHello extension can be used to
      negotiate the version of TLS to use, in preference to the
      legacy_version field of the ClientHello.

   -  The "signature_algorithms_cert" extension allows a client to
      indicate which signature algorithms it can validate in X.509
      certificates.

   Additionally, this document clarifies some compliance requirements
   for earlier versions of TLS; see Section 9.3. 





## 2. Protocol Overview

   The cryptographic parameters used by the secure channel are produced
   by the TLS handshake protocol.  This sub-protocol of TLS is used by
   the client and server when first communicating with each other.  The
   handshake protocol allows peers to negotiate a protocol version,
   select cryptographic algorithms, optionally authenticate each other,
   and establish shared secret keying material.  Once the handshake is
   complete, the peers use the established keys to protect the
   application-layer traffic.

   A failure of the handshake or other protocol error triggers the
   termination of the connection, optionally preceded by an alert
   message (Section 6).

   TLS supports three basic key exchange modes:

   -  (EC)DHE (Diffie-Hellman over either finite fields or elliptic
      curves)

   -  PSK-only

   -  PSK with (EC)DHE 
   Figure 1 below shows the basic full TLS handshake:

                 messages/extensions that are not always sent.

              {} Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from a [sender ]_handshake_traffic_secret.

              [] Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from [sender ]_application_traffic_secret_N.

               Figure 1: Message Flow for Full TLS Handshake

   The handshake can be thought of as having three phases (indicated in
   the diagram above):

   -  Key Exchange: Establish shared keying material and select the
      cryptographic parameters.  Everything after this phase is
      encrypted.

   -  Server Parameters: Establish other handshake parameters
      (whether the client is authenticated, application-layer protocol
      support, etc.). 
   -  Authentication: Authenticate the server (and, optionally, the
      client) and provide key confirmation and handshake integrity.

   In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello
   (Section 4.1.2) message, which contains a random nonce
   (ClientHello.random); its offered protocol versions; a list of
   symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs; either a set of Diffie-Hellman key
   shares (in the "key_share" (Section 4.2.8) extension), a set of
   pre-shared key labels (in the "pre_shared_key" (Section 4.2.11)
   extension), or both; and potentially additional extensions.
   Additional fields and/or messages may also be present for middlebox
   compatibility.

   The server processes the ClientHello and determines the appropriate
   cryptographic parameters for the connection.  It then responds with
   its own ServerHello (Section 4.1.3), which indicates the negotiated
   connection parameters.  The combination of the ClientHello and the
   ServerHello determines the shared keys.  If (EC)DHE key establishment
   is in use, then the ServerHello contains a "key_share" extension with
   the server's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman share; the server's share MUST
   be in the same group as one of the client's shares.  If PSK key
   establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains a
   "pre_shared_key" extension indicating which of the client's offered
   PSKs was selected.  Note that implementations can use (EC)DHE and PSK
   together, in which case both extensions will be supplied.

   The server then sends two messages to establish the Server
   Parameters:

   EncryptedExtensions:  responses to ClientHello extensions that are
      not required to determine the cryptographic parameters, other than
      those that are specific to individual certificates.
      [Section 4.3.1]

   CertificateRequest:  if certificate-based client authentication is
      desired, the desired parameters for that certificate.  This
      message is omitted if client authentication is not desired.
      [Section 4.3.2]
   Finally, the client and server exchange Authentication messages.  TLS
   uses the same set of messages every time that certificate-based
   authentication is needed.  (PSK-based authentication happens as a
   side effect of key exchange.)  Specifically:

   Certificate:  The certificate of the endpoint and any per-certificate
      extensions.  This message is omitted by the server if not
      authenticating with a certificate and by the client if the server
      did not send CertificateRequest (thus indicating that the client
      should not authenticate with a certificate).  Note that if raw
      public keys [RFC7250] or the cached information extension
      [RFC7924] are in use, then this message will not contain a
      certificate but rather some other value corresponding to the
      server's long-term key.  [Section 4.4.2]

   CertificateVerify:  A signature over the entire handshake using the
      private key corresponding to the public key in the Certificate
      message.  This message is omitted if the endpoint is not
      authenticating via a certificate.  [Section 4.4.3]

   Finished:  A MAC (Message Authentication Code) over the entire
      handshake.  This message provides key confirmation, binds the
      endpoint's identity to the exchanged keys, and in PSK mode also
      authenticates the handshake.  [Section 4.4.4]

   Upon receiving the server's messages, the client responds with its
   Authentication messages, namely Certificate and CertificateVerify (if
   requested), and Finished.

   At this point, the handshake is complete, and the client and server
   derive the keying material required by the record layer to exchange
   application-layer data protected through authenticated encryption.
   Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished
   message, except as specified in Section 2.3.  Note that while the
   server may send Application Data prior to receiving the client's
   Authentication messages, any data sent at that point is, of course,
   being sent to an unauthenticated peer. 





### 2.1. Incorrect DHE Share

   If the client has not provided a sufficient "key_share" extension
   (e.g., it includes only DHE or ECDHE groups unacceptable to or
   unsupported by the server), the server corrects the mismatch with a
   HelloRetryRequest and the client needs to restart the handshake with
   an appropriate "key_share" extension, as shown in Figure 2.  If no
   common cryptographic parameters can be negotiated, the server MUST
   abort the handshake with an appropriate alert.

        Client                                               Server

        ClientHello
        + key_share             -------->
                                                  HelloRetryRequest
                                <--------               + key_share
        ClientHello
        + key_share             -------->
                                                        ServerHello
                                                        + key_share
                                              {EncryptedExtensions}
                                              {CertificateRequest*}
                                                     {Certificate*}
                                               {CertificateVerify*}
                                                         {Finished}
                                <--------       [Application Data*]
        {Certificate*}
        {CertificateVerify*}
        {Finished}              -------->
        [Application Data]      <------->        [Application Data]

             Figure 2: Message Flow for a Full Handshake with
                           Mismatched Parameters

   Note: The handshake transcript incorporates the initial
   ClientHello/HelloRetryRequest exchange; it is not reset with the
   new ClientHello.

   TLS also allows several optimized variants of the basic handshake, as
   described in the following sections. 





### 2.2. Resumption and Pre-Shared Key (PSK)

   Although TLS PSKs can be established out of band, PSKs can also be
   established in a previous connection and then used to establish a new
   connection ("session resumption" or "resuming" with a PSK).  Once a
   handshake has completed, the server can send the client a PSK
   identity that corresponds to a unique key derived from the initial
   handshake (see Section 4.6.1).  The client can then use that PSK
   identity in future handshakes to negotiate the use of the associated
   PSK.  If the server accepts the PSK, then the security context of the
   new connection is cryptographically tied to the original connection
   and the key derived from the initial handshake is used to bootstrap
   the cryptographic state instead of a full handshake.  In TLS 1.2 and
   below, this functionality was provided by "session IDs" and "session
   tickets" [RFC5077].  Both mechanisms are obsoleted in TLS 1.3.

   PSKs can be used with (EC)DHE key exchange in order to provide
   forward secrecy in combination with shared keys, or can be used
   alone, at the cost of losing forward secrecy for the application
   data. 
   Figure 3 shows a pair of handshakes in which the first handshake
   establishes a PSK and the second handshake uses it:

          Client                                               Server

   Initial Handshake:
          ClientHello
          + key_share               -------->
                                                          ServerHello
                                                          + key_share
                                                {EncryptedExtensions}
                                                {CertificateRequest*}
                                                       {Certificate*}
                                                 {CertificateVerify*}
                                                           {Finished}
                                    <--------     [Application Data*]
          {Certificate*}
          {CertificateVerify*}
          {Finished}                -------->
                                    <--------      [NewSessionTicket]
          [Application Data]        <------->      [Application Data]


   Subsequent Handshake:
          ClientHello
          + key_share*
          + pre_shared_key          -------->
                                                          ServerHello
                                                     + pre_shared_key
                                                         + key_share*
                                                {EncryptedExtensions}
                                                           {Finished}
                                    <--------     [Application Data*]
          {Finished}                -------->
          [Application Data]        <------->      [Application Data]

               Figure 3: Message Flow for Resumption and PSK

   As the server is authenticating via a PSK, it does not send a
   Certificate or a CertificateVerify message.  When a client offers
   resumption via a PSK, it SHOULD also supply a "key_share" extension
   to the server to allow the server to decline resumption and fall back
   to a full handshake, if needed.  The server responds with a
   "pre_shared_key" extension to negotiate the use of PSK key
   establishment and can (as shown here) respond with a "key_share"
   extension to do (EC)DHE key establishment, thus providing forward
   secrecy. 
   When PSKs are provisioned out of band, the PSK identity and the KDF
   hash algorithm to be used with the PSK MUST also be provisioned.

   Note:  When using an out-of-band provisioned pre-shared secret, a
      critical consideration is using sufficient entropy during the key
      generation, as discussed in [RFC4086].  Deriving a shared secret
      from a password or other low-entropy sources is not secure.  A
      low-entropy secret, or password, is subject to dictionary attacks
      based on the PSK binder.  The specified PSK authentication is not
      a strong password-based authenticated key exchange even when used
      with Diffie-Hellman key establishment.  Specifically, it does not
      prevent an attacker that can observe the handshake from performing
      a brute-force attack on the password/pre-shared key.

### 2.3. 0-RTT Data

   When clients and servers share a PSK (either obtained externally or
   via a previous handshake), TLS 1.3 allows clients to send data on the
   first flight ("early data").  The client uses the PSK to authenticate
   the server and to encrypt the early data.

   As shown in Figure 4, the 0-RTT data is just added to the 1-RTT
   handshake in the first flight.  The rest of the handshake uses the
   same messages as for a 1-RTT handshake with PSK resumption. 
         Client                                               Server

         ClientHello
         + early_data
         + key_share*
         + psk_key_exchange_modes
         + pre_shared_key
         (Application Data*)     -------->
                                                         ServerHello
                                                    + pre_shared_key
                                                        + key_share*
                                               {EncryptedExtensions}
                                                       + early_data*
                                                          {Finished}
                                 <--------       [Application Data*]
         (EndOfEarlyData)
         {Finished}              -------->
         [Application Data]      <------->        [Application Data]

               +  Indicates noteworthy extensions sent in the
                  previously noted message.

               *  Indicates optional or situation-dependent
                  messages/extensions that are not always sent.

               () Indicates messages protected using keys
                  derived from a client_early_traffic_secret.

               {} Indicates messages protected using keys
                  derived from a [sender ]_handshake_traffic_secret.

               [] Indicates messages protected using keys
                  derived from [sender ]_application_traffic_secret_N.

               Figure 4: Message Flow for a 0-RTT Handshake 
   IMPORTANT NOTE: The security properties for 0-RTT data are weaker
   than those for other kinds of TLS data.  Specifically:

   1.  This data is not forward secret, as it is encrypted solely under
       keys derived using the offered PSK.

   2.  There are no guarantees of non-replay between connections.
       Protection against replay for ordinary TLS 1.3 1-RTT data is
       provided via the server's Random value, but 0-RTT data does not
       depend on the ServerHello and therefore has weaker guarantees.
       This is especially relevant if the data is authenticated either
       with TLS client authentication or inside the application
       protocol.  The same warnings apply to any use of the
       early_exporter_master_secret.

   0-RTT data cannot be duplicated within a connection (i.e., the server
   will not process the same data twice for the same connection), and an
   attacker will not be able to make 0-RTT data appear to be 1-RTT data
   (because it is protected with different keys).  Appendix E.5 contains
   a description of potential attacks, and Section 8 describes
   mechanisms which the server can use to limit the impact of replay.

## 4. Handshake Protocol

   The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters
   of a connection.  Handshake messages are supplied to the TLS record
   layer, where they are encapsulated within one or more TLSPlaintext or
   TLSCiphertext structures which are processed and transmitted as
   specified by the current active connection state. 
      enum {
          client_hello(1),
          server_hello(2),
          new_session_ticket(4),
          end_of_early_data(5),
          encrypted_extensions(8),
          certificate(11),
          certificate_request(13),
          certificate_verify(15),
          finished(20),
          key_update(24),
          message_hash(254),
          (255)
      } HandshakeType;

      struct {
          HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
          uint24 length;             /* remaining bytes in message */
          select (Handshake.msg_type) {
              case client_hello:          ClientHello;
              case server_hello:          ServerHello;
              case end_of_early_data:     EndOfEarlyData;
              case encrypted_extensions:  EncryptedExtensions;
              case certificate_request:   CertificateRequest;
              case certificate:           Certificate;
              case certificate_verify:    CertificateVerify;
              case finished:              Finished;
              case new_session_ticket:    NewSessionTicket;
              case key_update:            KeyUpdate;
          };
      } Handshake;

   Protocol messages MUST be sent in the order defined in Section 4.4.1   and shown in the diagrams in Section 2.  A peer which receives a
   handshake message in an unexpected order MUST abort the handshake
   with an "unexpected_message" alert.

   New handshake message types are assigned by IANA as described in Section 11.

### 4.1. Key Exchange Messages

   The key exchange messages are used to determine the security
   capabilities of the client and the server and to establish shared
   secrets, including the traffic keys used to protect the rest of the
   handshake and the data. 





#### 4.1.1. Cryptographic Negotiation

   In TLS, the cryptographic negotiation proceeds by the client offering
   the following four sets of options in its ClientHello:

   -  A list of cipher suites which indicates the AEAD algorithm/HKDF
      hash pairs which the client supports.

   -  A "supported_groups" (Section 4.2.7) extension which indicates the
      (EC)DHE groups which the client supports and a "key_share"
      (Section 4.2.8) extension which contains (EC)DHE shares for some
      or all of these groups.

   -  A "signature_algorithms" (Section 4.2.3) extension which indicates
      the signature algorithms which the client can accept.  A
      "signature_algorithms_cert" extension (Section 4.2.3) may also be
      added to indicate certificate-specific signature algorithms.

   -  A "pre_shared_key" (Section 4.2.11) extension which contains a
      list of symmetric key identities known to the client and a
      "psk_key_exchange_modes" (Section 4.2.9) extension which indicates
      the key exchange modes that may be used with PSKs.

   If the server does not select a PSK, then the first three of these
   options are entirely orthogonal: the server independently selects a
   cipher suite, an (EC)DHE group and key share for key establishment,
   and a signature algorithm/certificate pair to authenticate itself to
   the client.  If there is no overlap between the received
   "supported_groups" and the groups supported by the server, then the
   server MUST abort the handshake with a "handshake_failure" or an
   "insufficient_security" alert.

   If the server selects a PSK, then it MUST also select a key
   establishment mode from the set indicated by the client's
   "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension (at present, PSK alone or with
   (EC)DHE).  Note that if the PSK can be used without (EC)DHE, then
   non-overlap in the "supported_groups" parameters need not be fatal,
   as it is in the non-PSK case discussed in the previous paragraph.

   If the server selects an (EC)DHE group and the client did not offer a
   compatible "key_share" extension in the initial ClientHello, the
   server MUST respond with a HelloRetryRequest (Section 4.1.4) message. 
   If the server successfully selects parameters and does not require a
   HelloRetryRequest, it indicates the selected parameters in the
   ServerHello as follows:

   -  If PSK is being used, then the server will send a "pre_shared_key"
      extension indicating the selected key.

   -  When (EC)DHE is in use, the server will also provide a "key_share"
      extension.  If PSK is not being used, then (EC)DHE and
      certificate-based authentication are always used.

   -  When authenticating via a certificate, the server will send the
      Certificate (Section 4.4.2) and CertificateVerify (Section 4.4.3)
      messages.  In TLS 1.3 as defined by this document, either a PSK or
      a certificate is always used, but not both.  Future documents may
      define how to use them together.

   If the server is unable to negotiate a supported set of parameters
   (i.e., there is no overlap between the client and server parameters),
   it MUST abort the handshake with either a "handshake_failure" or
   "insufficient_security" fatal alert (see Section 6).

#### 4.1.2. Client Hello

   When a client first connects to a server, it is REQUIRED to send the
   ClientHello as its first TLS message.  The client will also send a
   ClientHello when the server has responded to its ClientHello with a
   HelloRetryRequest.  In that case, the client MUST send the same
   ClientHello without modification, except as follows:

   -  If a "key_share" extension was supplied in the HelloRetryRequest,
      replacing the list of shares with a list containing a single
      KeyShareEntry from the indicated group.

   -  Removing the "early_data" extension (Section 4.2.10) if one was
      present.  Early data is not permitted after a HelloRetryRequest.

   -  Including a "cookie" extension if one was provided in the
      HelloRetryRequest. 
   -  Updating the "pre_shared_key" extension if present by recomputing
      the "obfuscated_ticket_age" and binder values and (optionally)
      removing any PSKs which are incompatible with the server's
      indicated cipher suite.

   -  Optionally adding, removing, or changing the length of the
      "padding" extension [RFC7685].

   -  Other modifications that may be allowed by an extension defined in
      the future and present in the HelloRetryRequest.

   Because TLS 1.3 forbids renegotiation, if a server has negotiated
   TLS 1.3 and receives a ClientHello at any other time, it MUST
   terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.

   If a server established a TLS connection with a previous version of
   TLS and receives a TLS 1.3 ClientHello in a renegotiation, it MUST
   retain the previous protocol version.  In particular, it MUST NOT
   negotiate TLS 1.3.

   Structure of this message:

      uint16 ProtocolVersion;
      opaque Random[32];

      uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303;    /* TLS v1.2 */
          Random random;
          opaque legacy_session_id<0..32>;
          CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
          opaque legacy_compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
          Extension extensions<8..2^16-1>;
      } ClientHello;
   legacy_version:  In previous versions of TLS, this field was used for
      version negotiation and represented the highest version number
      supported by the client.  Experience has shown that many servers
      do not properly implement version negotiation, leading to "version
      intolerance" in which the server rejects an otherwise acceptable
      ClientHello with a version number higher than it supports.  In
      TLS 1.3, the client indicates its version preferences in the
      "supported_versions" extension (Section 4.2.1) and the
      legacy_version field MUST be set to 0x0303, which is the version
      number for TLS 1.2.  TLS 1.3 ClientHellos are identified as having
      a legacy_version of 0x0303 and a supported_versions extension
      present with 0x0304 as the highest version indicated therein.
      (See Appendix D  for details about backward compatibility.)

   random:  32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.  See Appendix C  for additional information.

   legacy_session_id:  Versions of TLS before TLS 1.3 supported a
      "session resumption" feature which has been merged with pre-shared
      keys in this version (see Section 2.2).  A client which has a
      cached session ID set by a pre-TLS 1.3 server SHOULD set this
      field to that value.  In compatibility mode (see Appendix D.4),
      this field MUST be non-empty, so a client not offering a
      pre-TLS 1.3 session MUST generate a new 32-byte value.  This value
      need not be random but SHOULD be unpredictable to avoid
      implementations fixating on a specific value (also known as
      ossification).  Otherwise, it MUST be set as a zero-length vector
      (i.e., a zero-valued single byte length field).

   cipher_suites:  A list of the symmetric cipher options supported by
      the client, specifically the record protection algorithm
      (including secret key length) and a hash to be used with HKDF, in
      descending order of client preference.  Values are defined in Appendix B.4.  If the list contains cipher suites that the server
      does not recognize, support, or wish to use, the server MUST
      ignore those cipher suites and process the remaining ones as
      usual.  If the client is attempting a PSK key establishment, it
      SHOULD advertise at least one cipher suite indicating a Hash
      associated with the PSK. 
   legacy_compression_methods:  Versions of TLS before 1.3 supported
      compression with the list of supported compression methods being
      sent in this field.  For every TLS 1.3 ClientHello, this vector
      MUST contain exactly one byte, set to zero, which corresponds to
      the "null" compression method in prior versions of TLS.  If a
      TLS 1.3 ClientHello is received with any other value in this
      field, the server MUST abort the handshake with an
      "illegal_parameter" alert.  Note that TLS 1.3 servers might
      receive TLS 1.2 or prior ClientHellos which contain other
      compression methods and (if negotiating such a prior version) MUST
      follow the procedures for the appropriate prior version of TLS.

   extensions:  Clients request extended functionality from servers by
      sending data in the extensions field.  The actual "Extension"
      format is defined in Section 4.2.  In TLS 1.3, the use of certain
      extensions is mandatory, as functionality has moved into
      extensions to preserve ClientHello compatibility with previous
      versions of TLS.  Servers MUST ignore unrecognized extensions.

   All versions of TLS allow an extensions field to optionally follow
   the compression_methods field.  TLS 1.3 ClientHello messages always
   contain extensions (minimally "supported_versions", otherwise, they
   will be interpreted as TLS 1.2 ClientHello messages).  However,
   TLS 1.3 servers might receive ClientHello messages without an
   extensions field from prior versions of TLS.  The presence of
   extensions can be detected by determining whether there are bytes
   following the compression_methods field at the end of the
   ClientHello.  Note that this method of detecting optional data
   differs from the normal TLS method of having a variable-length field,
   but it is used for compatibility with TLS before extensions were
   defined.  TLS 1.3 servers will need to perform this check first and
   only attempt to negotiate TLS 1.3 if the "supported_versions"
   extension is present.  If negotiating a version of TLS prior to 1.3,
   a server MUST check that the message either contains no data after
   legacy_compression_methods or that it contains a valid extensions
   block with no data following.  If not, then it MUST abort the
   handshake with a "decode_error" alert.

   In the event that a client requests additional functionality using
   extensions and this functionality is not supplied by the server, the
   client MAY abort the handshake.

   After sending the ClientHello message, the client waits for a
   ServerHello or HelloRetryRequest message.  If early data is in use,
   the client may transmit early Application Data (Section 2.3) while
   waiting for the next handshake message. 





#### 4.1.3. Server Hello

   The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello
   message to proceed with the handshake if it is able to negotiate an
   acceptable set of handshake parameters based on the ClientHello.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303;    /* TLS v1.2 */
          Random random;
          opaque legacy_session_id_echo<0..32>;
          CipherSuite cipher_suite;
          uint8 legacy_compression_method = 0;
          Extension extensions<6..2^16-1>;
      } ServerHello;

   legacy_version:  In previous versions of TLS, this field was used for
      version negotiation and represented the selected version number
      for the connection.  Unfortunately, some middleboxes fail when
      presented with new values.  In TLS 1.3, the TLS server indicates
      its version using the "supported_versions" extension
      (Section 4.2.1), and the legacy_version field MUST be set to
      0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2.  (See Appendix D       for details about backward compatibility.)

   random:  32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.  See Appendix C  for additional information.  The last 8 bytes MUST be
      overwritten as described below if negotiating TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1,
      but the remaining bytes MUST be random.  This structure is
      generated by the server and MUST be generated independently of the
      ClientHello.random.

   legacy_session_id_echo:  The contents of the client's
      legacy_session_id field.  Note that this field is echoed even if
      the client's value corresponded to a cached pre-TLS 1.3 session
      which the server has chosen not to resume.  A client which
      receives a legacy_session_id_echo field that does not match what
      it sent in the ClientHello MUST abort the handshake with an
      "illegal_parameter" alert.

   cipher_suite:  The single cipher suite selected by the server from
      the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.  A client which receives a
      cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake with an
      "illegal_parameter" alert.

   legacy_compression_method:  A single byte which MUST have the
      value 0. 
   extensions:  A list of extensions.  The ServerHello MUST only include
      extensions which are required to establish the cryptographic
      context and negotiate the protocol version.  All TLS 1.3
      ServerHello messages MUST contain the "supported_versions"
      extension.  Current ServerHello messages additionally contain
      either the "pre_shared_key" extension or the "key_share"
      extension, or both (when using a PSK with (EC)DHE key
      establishment).  Other extensions (see Section 4.2) are sent
      separately in the EncryptedExtensions message.

   For reasons of backward compatibility with middleboxes (see Appendix D.4), the HelloRetryRequest message uses the same structure
   as the ServerHello, but with Random set to the special value of the
   SHA-256 of "HelloRetryRequest":

     CF 21 AD 74 E5 9A 61 11 BE 1D 8C 02 1E 65 B8 91
     C2 A2 11 16 7A BB 8C 5E 07 9E 09 E2 C8 A8 33 9C

   Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST
   first examine the Random value and, if it matches this value, process
   it as described in Section 4.1.4).

   TLS 1.3 has a downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's
   random value.  TLS 1.3 servers which negotiate TLS 1.2 or below in
   response to a ClientHello MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random
   value specially in their ServerHello.

   If negotiating TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 servers MUST set the last 8 bytes of
   their Random value to the bytes:

     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01

   If negotiating TLS 1.1 or below, TLS 1.3 servers MUST, and TLS 1.2
   servers SHOULD, set the last 8 bytes of their ServerHello.Random
   value to the bytes:

     44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00

   TLS 1.3 clients receiving a ServerHello indicating TLS 1.2 or below
   MUST check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to either of these
   values.  TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD also check that the last 8 bytes are
   not equal to the second value if the ServerHello indicates TLS 1.1 or
   below.  If a match is found, the client MUST abort the handshake with
   an "illegal_parameter" alert.  This mechanism provides limited
   protection against downgrade attacks over and above what is provided
   by the Finished exchange: because the ServerKeyExchange, a message
   present in TLS 1.2 and below, includes a signature over both random
   values, it is not possible for an active attacker to modify the 
   random values without detection as long as ephemeral ciphers are
   used.  It does not provide downgrade protection when static RSA
   is used.

   Note: This is a change from [RFC5246], so in practice many TLS 1.2
   clients and servers will not behave as specified above.

   A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior
   and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST
   abort the handshake with a "protocol_version" alert.  Note that
   renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.

#### 4.1.4. Hello Retry Request

   The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello
   message if it is able to find an acceptable set of parameters but the
   ClientHello does not contain sufficient information to proceed with
   the handshake.  As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the HelloRetryRequest
   has the same format as a ServerHello message, and the legacy_version,
   legacy_session_id_echo, cipher_suite, and legacy_compression_method
   fields have the same meaning.  However, for convenience we discuss
   "HelloRetryRequest" throughout this document as if it were a distinct
   message.

   The server's extensions MUST contain "supported_versions".
   Additionally, it SHOULD contain the minimal set of extensions
   necessary for the client to generate a correct ClientHello pair.  As
   with the ServerHello, a HelloRetryRequest MUST NOT contain any
   extensions that were not first offered by the client in its
   ClientHello, with the exception of optionally the "cookie" (see Section 4.2.2) extension.

   Upon receipt of a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST check the
   legacy_version, legacy_session_id_echo, cipher_suite, and
   legacy_compression_method as specified in Section 4.1.3 and then
   process the extensions, starting with determining the version using
   "supported_versions".  Clients MUST abort the handshake with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert if the HelloRetryRequest would not result
   in any change in the ClientHello.  If a client receives a second
   HelloRetryRequest in the same connection (i.e., where the ClientHello
   was itself in response to a HelloRetryRequest), it MUST abort the
   handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert. 
   Otherwise, the client MUST process all extensions in the
   HelloRetryRequest and send a second updated ClientHello.  The
   HelloRetryRequest extensions defined in this specification are:

   -  supported_versions (see Section 4.2.1)

   -  cookie (see Section 4.2.2)

   -  key_share (see Section 4.2.8)

   A client which receives a cipher suite that was not offered MUST
   abort the handshake.  Servers MUST ensure that they negotiate the
   same cipher suite when receiving a conformant updated ClientHello (if
   the server selects the cipher suite as the first step in the
   negotiation, then this will happen automatically).  Upon receiving
   the ServerHello, clients MUST check that the cipher suite supplied in
   the ServerHello is the same as that in the HelloRetryRequest and
   otherwise abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   In addition, in its updated ClientHello, the client SHOULD NOT offer
   any pre-shared keys associated with a hash other than that of the
   selected cipher suite.  This allows the client to avoid having to
   compute partial hash transcripts for multiple hashes in the second
   ClientHello.

   The value of selected_version in the HelloRetryRequest
   "supported_versions" extension MUST be retained in the ServerHello,
   and a client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter"
   alert if the value changes. 





### 4.2. Extensions

   A number of TLS messages contain tag-length-value encoded extensions
   structures.

    struct {
        ExtensionType extension_type;
        opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
    } Extension;

    enum {
        server_name(0),                             /* RFC 6066 */
        max_fragment_length(1),                     /* RFC 6066 */
        status_request(5),                          /* RFC 6066 */
        supported_groups(10),                       /* RFC 8422, 7919 */
        signature_algorithms(13),                   /* RFC 8446 */
        use_srtp(14),                               /* RFC 5764 */
        heartbeat(15),                              /* RFC 6520 */
        application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16), /* RFC 7301 */
        signed_certificate_timestamp(18),           /* RFC 6962 */
        client_certificate_type(19),                /* RFC 7250 */
        server_certificate_type(20),                /* RFC 7250 */
        padding(21),                                /* RFC 7685 */
        pre_shared_key(41),                         /* RFC 8446 */
        early_data(42),                             /* RFC 8446 */
        supported_versions(43),                     /* RFC 8446 */
        cookie(44),                                 /* RFC 8446 */
        psk_key_exchange_modes(45),                 /* RFC 8446 */
        certificate_authorities(47),                /* RFC 8446 */
        oid_filters(48),                            /* RFC 8446 */
        post_handshake_auth(49),                    /* RFC 8446 */
        signature_algorithms_cert(50),              /* RFC 8446 */
        key_share(51),                              /* RFC 8446 */
        (65535)
    } ExtensionType;
   Here:

   -  "extension_type" identifies the particular extension type.

   -  "extension_data" contains information specific to the particular
      extension type.

   The list of extension types is maintained by IANA as described in Section 11.

   Extensions are generally structured in a request/response fashion,
   though some extensions are just indications with no corresponding
   response.  The client sends its extension requests in the ClientHello
   message, and the server sends its extension responses in the
   ServerHello, EncryptedExtensions, HelloRetryRequest, and Certificate
   messages.  The server sends extension requests in the
   CertificateRequest message which a client MAY respond to with a
   Certificate message.  The server MAY also send unsolicited extensions
   in the NewSessionTicket, though the client does not respond directly
   to these.

   Implementations MUST NOT send extension responses if the remote
   endpoint did not send the corresponding extension requests, with the
   exception of the "cookie" extension in the HelloRetryRequest.  Upon
   receiving such an extension, an endpoint MUST abort the handshake
   with an "unsupported_extension" alert.

   The table below indicates the messages where a given extension may
   appear, using the following notation: CH (ClientHello),
   SH (ServerHello), EE (EncryptedExtensions), CT (Certificate),
   CR (CertificateRequest), NST (NewSessionTicket), and
   HRR (HelloRetryRequest).  If an implementation receives an extension
   which it recognizes and which is not specified for the message in
   which it appears, it MUST abort the handshake with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert.

   +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   When multiple extensions of different types are present, the
   extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of
   "pre_shared_key" (Section 4.2.11) which MUST be the last extension in
   the ClientHello (but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello
   extensions block).  There MUST NOT be more than one extension of the
   same type in a given extension block.

   In TLS 1.3, unlike TLS 1.2, extensions are negotiated for each
   handshake even when in resumption-PSK mode.  However, 0-RTT
   parameters are those negotiated in the previous handshake; mismatches
   may require rejecting 0-RTT (see Section 4.2.10).

   There are subtle (and not so subtle) interactions that may occur in
   this protocol between new features and existing features which may
   result in a significant reduction in overall security.  The following
   considerations should be taken into account when designing new
   extensions:

   -  Some cases where a server does not agree to an extension are error
      conditions (e.g., the handshake cannot continue), and some are
      simply refusals to support particular features.  In general, error
      alerts should be used for the former and a field in the server
      extension response for the latter.

   -  Extensions should, as far as possible, be designed to prevent any
      attack that forces use (or non-use) of a particular feature by
      manipulation of handshake messages.  This principle should be
      followed regardless of whether the feature is believed to cause a
      security problem.  Often the fact that the extension fields are
      included in the inputs to the Finished message hashes will be
      sufficient, but extreme care is needed when the extension changes
      the meaning of messages sent in the handshake phase.  Designers
      and implementors should be aware of the fact that until the
      handshake has been authenticated, active attackers can modify
      messages and insert, remove, or replace extensions. 





#### 4.2.1. Supported Versions

      struct {
          select (Handshake.msg_type) {
              case client_hello:
                   ProtocolVersion versions<2..254>;

              case server_hello: /* and HelloRetryRequest */
                   ProtocolVersion selected_version;
          };
      } SupportedVersions;

   The "supported_versions" extension is used by the client to indicate
   which versions of TLS it supports and by the server to indicate which
   version it is using.  The extension contains a list of supported
   versions in preference order, with the most preferred version first.
   Implementations of this specification MUST send this extension in the
   ClientHello containing all versions of TLS which they are prepared to
   negotiate (for this specification, that means minimally 0x0304, but
   if previous versions of TLS are allowed to be negotiated, they MUST
   be present as well).

   If this extension is not present, servers which are compliant with
   this specification and which also support TLS 1.2 MUST negotiate
   TLS 1.2 or prior as specified in [RFC5246], even if
   ClientHello.legacy_version is 0x0304 or later.  Servers MAY abort the
   handshake upon receiving a ClientHello with legacy_version 0x0304 or
   later.

   If this extension is present in the ClientHello, servers MUST NOT use
   the ClientHello.legacy_version value for version negotiation and MUST
   use only the "supported_versions" extension to determine client
   preferences.  Servers MUST only select a version of TLS present in
   that extension and MUST ignore any unknown versions that are present
   in that extension.  Note that this mechanism makes it possible to
   negotiate a version prior to TLS 1.2 if one side supports a sparse
   range.  Implementations of TLS 1.3 which choose to support prior
   versions of TLS SHOULD support TLS 1.2.  Servers MUST be prepared to
   receive ClientHellos that include this extension but do not include
   0x0304 in the list of versions.

   A server which negotiates a version of TLS prior to TLS 1.3 MUST set
   ServerHello.version and MUST NOT send the "supported_versions"
   extension.  A server which negotiates TLS 1.3 MUST respond by sending
   a "supported_versions" extension containing the selected version
   value (0x0304).  It MUST set the ServerHello.legacy_version field to
   0x0303 (TLS 1.2).  Clients MUST check for this extension prior to
   processing the rest of the ServerHello (although they will have to 
   parse the ServerHello in order to read the extension).  If this
   extension is present, clients MUST ignore the
   ServerHello.legacy_version value and MUST use only the
   "supported_versions" extension to determine the selected version.  If
   the "supported_versions" extension in the ServerHello contains a
   version not offered by the client or contains a version prior to
   TLS 1.3, the client MUST abort the handshake with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert.

#### 4.2.2. Cookie

      struct {
          opaque cookie<1..2^16-1>;
      } Cookie;

   Cookies serve two primary purposes:

   -  Allowing the server to force the client to demonstrate
      reachability at their apparent network address (thus providing a
      measure of DoS protection).  This is primarily useful for
      non-connection-oriented transports (see [RFC6347] for an example
      of this).

   -  Allowing the server to offload state to the client, thus allowing
      it to send a HelloRetryRequest without storing any state.  The
      server can do this by storing the hash of the ClientHello in the
      HelloRetryRequest cookie (protected with some suitable integrity
      protection algorithm).

   When sending a HelloRetryRequest, the server MAY provide a "cookie"
   extension to the client (this is an exception to the usual rule that
   the only extensions that may be sent are those that appear in the
   ClientHello).  When sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST copy
   the contents of the extension received in the HelloRetryRequest into
   a "cookie" extension in the new ClientHello.  Clients MUST NOT use
   cookies in their initial ClientHello in subsequent connections.

   When a server is operating statelessly, it may receive an unprotected
   record of type change_cipher_spec between the first and second
   ClientHello (see Section 5).  Since the server is not storing any
   state, this will appear as if it were the first message to be
   received.  Servers operating statelessly MUST ignore these records. 





#### 4.2.3. Signature Algorithms

   TLS 1.3 provides two extensions for indicating which signature
   algorithms may be used in digital signatures.  The
   "signature_algorithms_cert" extension applies to signatures in
   certificates, and the "signature_algorithms" extension, which
   originally appeared in TLS 1.2, applies to signatures in
   CertificateVerify messages.  The keys found in certificates MUST also
   be of appropriate type for the signature algorithms they are used
   with.  This is a particular issue for RSA keys and PSS signatures, as
   described below.  If no "signature_algorithms_cert" extension is
   present, then the "signature_algorithms" extension also applies to
   signatures appearing in certificates.  Clients which desire the
   server to authenticate itself via a certificate MUST send the
   "signature_algorithms" extension.  If a server is authenticating via
   a certificate and the client has not sent a "signature_algorithms"
   extension, then the server MUST abort the handshake with a
   "missing_extension" alert (see Section 9.2).

   The "signature_algorithms_cert" extension was added to allow
   implementations which supported different sets of algorithms for
   certificates and in TLS itself to clearly signal their capabilities.
   TLS 1.2 implementations SHOULD also process this extension.
   Implementations which have the same policy in both cases MAY omit the
   "signature_algorithms_cert" extension. 
   The "extension_data" field of these extensions contains a
   SignatureSchemeList value:

      enum {
          /* RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms */
          rsa_pkcs1_sha256(0x0401),
          rsa_pkcs1_sha384(0x0501),
          rsa_pkcs1_sha512(0x0601),

          /* ECDSA algorithms */
          ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256(0x0403),
          ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384(0x0503),
          ecdsa_secp521r1_sha512(0x0603),

          /* RSASSA-PSS algorithms with public key OID rsaEncryption */
          rsa_pss_rsae_sha256(0x0804),
          rsa_pss_rsae_sha384(0x0805),
          rsa_pss_rsae_sha512(0x0806),

          /* EdDSA algorithms */
          ed25519(0x0807),
          ed448(0x0808),

          /* RSASSA-PSS algorithms with public key OID RSASSA-PSS */
          rsa_pss_pss_sha256(0x0809),
          rsa_pss_pss_sha384(0x080a),
          rsa_pss_pss_sha512(0x080b),

          /* Legacy algorithms */
          rsa_pkcs1_sha1(0x0201),
          ecdsa_sha1(0x0203),

          /* Reserved Code Points */
          private_use(0xFE00..0xFFFF),
          (0xFFFF)
      } SignatureScheme;

      struct {
          SignatureScheme supported_signature_algorithms<2..2^16-2>;
      } SignatureSchemeList;

   Note: This enum is named "SignatureScheme" because there is already a
   "SignatureAlgorithm" type in TLS 1.2, which this replaces.  We use
   the term "signature algorithm" throughout the text. 
   Each SignatureScheme value lists a single signature algorithm that
   the client is willing to verify.  The values are indicated in
   descending order of preference.  Note that a signature algorithm
   takes as input an arbitrary-length message, rather than a digest.
   Algorithms which traditionally act on a digest should be defined in
   TLS to first hash the input with a specified hash algorithm and then
   proceed as usual.  The code point groups listed above have the
   following meanings:

   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms:  Indicates a signature algorithm using
      RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 [RFC8017] with the corresponding hash algorithm
      as defined in [SHS ].  These values refer solely to signatures
      which appear in certificates (see Section 4.4.2.2) and are not
      defined for use in signed TLS handshake messages, although they
      MAY appear in "signature_algorithms" and
      "signature_algorithms_cert" for backward compatibility with
      TLS 1.2.

   ECDSA algorithms:  Indicates a signature algorithm using ECDSA
      [ECDSA ], the corresponding curve as defined in ANSI X9.62 [ECDSA ]
      and FIPS 186-4 [DSS ], and the corresponding hash algorithm as
      defined in [SHS ].  The signature is represented as a DER-encoded
      [X690] ECDSA-Sig-Value structure.

   RSASSA-PSS RSAE algorithms:  Indicates a signature algorithm using
      RSASSA-PSS [RFC8017] with mask generation function 1.  The digest
      used in the mask generation function and the digest being signed
      are both the corresponding hash algorithm as defined in [SHS ].
      The length of the Salt MUST be equal to the length of the output
      of the digest algorithm.  If the public key is carried in an X.509
      certificate, it MUST use the rsaEncryption OID [RFC5280].

   EdDSA algorithms:  Indicates a signature algorithm using EdDSA as
      defined in [RFC8032] or its successors.  Note that these
      correspond to the "PureEdDSA" algorithms and not the "prehash"
      variants.

   RSASSA-PSS PSS algorithms:  Indicates a signature algorithm using
      RSASSA-PSS [RFC8017] with mask generation function 1.  The digest
      used in the mask generation function and the digest being signed
      are both the corresponding hash algorithm as defined in [SHS ].
      The length of the Salt MUST be equal to the length of the digest
      algorithm.  If the public key is carried in an X.509 certificate,
      it MUST use the RSASSA-PSS OID [RFC5756].  When used in
      certificate signatures, the algorithm parameters MUST be DER
      encoded.  If the corresponding public key's parameters are
      present, then the parameters in the signature MUST be identical to
      those in the public key. 
   Legacy algorithms:  Indicates algorithms which are being deprecated
      because they use algorithms with known weaknesses, specifically
      SHA-1 which is used in this context with either (1) RSA using
      RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 or (2) ECDSA.  These values refer solely to
      signatures which appear in certificates (see Section 4.4.2.2) and
      are not defined for use in signed TLS handshake messages, although
      they MAY appear in "signature_algorithms" and
      "signature_algorithms_cert" for backward compatibility with
      TLS 1.2.  Endpoints SHOULD NOT negotiate these algorithms but are
      permitted to do so solely for backward compatibility.  Clients
      offering these values MUST list them as the lowest priority
      (listed after all other algorithms in SignatureSchemeList).
      TLS 1.3 servers MUST NOT offer a SHA-1 signed certificate unless
      no valid certificate chain can be produced without it (see Section 4.4.2.2).

   The signatures on certificates that are self-signed or certificates
   that are trust anchors are not validated, since they begin a
   certification path (see [RFC5280], Section 3.2).  A certificate that
   begins a certification path MAY use a signature algorithm that is not
   advertised as being supported in the "signature_algorithms"
   extension.

   Note that TLS 1.2 defines this extension differently.  TLS 1.3
   implementations willing to negotiate TLS 1.2 MUST behave in
   accordance with the requirements of [RFC5246] when negotiating that
   version.  In particular:

   -  TLS 1.2 ClientHellos MAY omit this extension.

   -  In TLS 1.2, the extension contained hash/signature pairs.  The
      pairs are encoded in two octets, so SignatureScheme values have
      been allocated to align with TLS 1.2's encoding.  Some legacy
      pairs are left unallocated.  These algorithms are deprecated as of
      TLS 1.3.  They MUST NOT be offered or negotiated by any
      implementation.  In particular, MD5 [SLOTH ], SHA-224, and DSA
      MUST NOT be used.

   -  ECDSA signature schemes align with TLS 1.2's ECDSA hash/signature
      pairs.  However, the old semantics did not constrain the signing
      curve.  If TLS 1.2 is negotiated, implementations MUST be prepared
      to accept a signature that uses any curve that they advertised in
      the "supported_groups" extension.

   -  Implementations that advertise support for RSASSA-PSS (which is
      mandatory in TLS 1.3) MUST be prepared to accept a signature using
      that scheme even when TLS 1.2 is negotiated.  In TLS 1.2,
      RSASSA-PSS is used with RSA cipher suites. 





#### 4.2.4. Certificate Authorities

   The "certificate_authorities" extension is used to indicate the
   certificate authorities (CAs) which an endpoint supports and which
   SHOULD be used by the receiving endpoint to guide certificate
   selection.

   The body of the "certificate_authorities" extension consists of a
   CertificateAuthoritiesExtension structure.

      opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;

      struct {
          DistinguishedName authorities<3..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateAuthoritiesExtension;

   authorities:  A list of the distinguished names [X501] of acceptable
      certificate authorities, represented in DER-encoded [X690] format.
      These distinguished names specify a desired distinguished name for
      a trust anchor or subordinate CA; thus, this message can be used
      to describe known trust anchors as well as a desired authorization
      space.

   The client MAY send the "certificate_authorities" extension in the
   ClientHello message.  The server MAY send it in the
   CertificateRequest message.

   The "trusted_ca_keys" extension [RFC6066], which serves a similar
   purpose but is more complicated, is not used in TLS 1.3 (although it
   may appear in ClientHello messages from clients which are offering
   prior versions of TLS).

#### 4.2.5. OID Filters

   The "oid_filters" extension allows servers to provide a set of
   OID/value pairs which it would like the client's certificate to
   match.  This extension, if provided by the server, MUST only be sent
   in the CertificateRequest message.

      struct {
          opaque certificate_extension_oid<1..2^8-1>;
          opaque certificate_extension_values<0..2^16-1>;
      } OIDFilter;

      struct {
          OIDFilter filters<0..2^16-1>;
      } OIDFilterExtension;
   filters:  A list of certificate extension OIDs [RFC5280] with their
      allowed value(s) and represented in DER-encoded [X690] format.
      Some certificate extension OIDs allow multiple values (e.g.,
      Extended Key Usage).  If the server has included a non-empty
      filters list, the client certificate included in the response MUST
      contain all of the specified extension OIDs that the client
      recognizes.  For each extension OID recognized by the client, all
      of the specified values MUST be present in the client certificate
      (but the certificate MAY have other values as well).  However, the
      client MUST ignore and skip any unrecognized certificate extension
      OIDs.  If the client ignored some of the required certificate
      extension OIDs and supplied a certificate that does not satisfy
      the request, the server MAY at its discretion either continue the
      connection without client authentication or abort the handshake
      with an "unsupported_certificate" alert.  Any given OID MUST NOT
      appear more than once in the filters list.

   PKIX RFCs define a variety of certificate extension OIDs and their
   corresponding value types.  Depending on the type, matching
   certificate extension values are not necessarily bitwise-equal.  It
   is expected that TLS implementations will rely on their PKI libraries
   to perform certificate selection using certificate extension OIDs.

   This document defines matching rules for two standard certificate
   extensions defined in [RFC5280]:

   -  The Key Usage extension in a certificate matches the request when
      all key usage bits asserted in the request are also asserted in
      the Key Usage certificate extension.

   -  The Extended Key Usage extension in a certificate matches the
      request when all key purpose OIDs present in the request are also
      found in the Extended Key Usage certificate extension.  The
      special anyExtendedKeyUsage OID MUST NOT be used in the request.

   Separate specifications may define matching rules for other
   certificate extensions. 





#### 4.2.6. Post-Handshake Client Authentication

   The "post_handshake_auth" extension is used to indicate that a client
   is willing to perform post-handshake authentication (Section 4.6.2).
   Servers MUST NOT send a post-handshake CertificateRequest to clients
   which do not offer this extension.  Servers MUST NOT send this
   extension.

      struct {} PostHandshakeAuth;

   The "extension_data" field of the "post_handshake_auth" extension is
   zero length.

#### 4.2.7. Supported Groups

   When sent by the client, the "supported_groups" extension indicates
   the named groups which the client supports for key exchange, ordered
   from most preferred to least preferred.

   Note: In versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.3, this extension was named
   "elliptic_curves" and only contained elliptic curve groups.  See
   [RFC8422] and [RFC7919].  This extension was also used to negotiate
   ECDSA curves.  Signature algorithms are now negotiated independently
   (see Section 4.2.3).

   The "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
   "NamedGroupList" value:

      enum {

          /* Elliptic Curve Groups (ECDHE) */
          secp256r1(0x0017), secp384r1(0x0018), secp521r1(0x0019),
          x25519(0x001D), x448(0x001E),

          /* Finite Field Groups (DHE) */
          ffdhe2048(0x0100), ffdhe3072(0x0101), ffdhe4096(0x0102),
          ffdhe6144(0x0103), ffdhe8192(0x0104),

          /* Reserved Code Points */
          ffdhe_private_use(0x01FC..0x01FF),
          ecdhe_private_use(0xFE00..0xFEFF),
          (0xFFFF)
      } NamedGroup;

      struct {
          NamedGroup named_group_list<2..2^16-1>;
      } NamedGroupList;
   Elliptic Curve Groups (ECDHE):  Indicates support for the
      corresponding named curve, defined in either FIPS 186-4 [DSS ] or
      [RFC7748].  Values 0xFE00 through 0xFEFF are reserved for
      Private Use [RFC8126].

   Finite Field Groups (DHE):  Indicates support for the corresponding
      finite field group, defined in [RFC7919].  Values 0x01FC through
      0x01FF are reserved for Private Use.

   Items in named_group_list are ordered according to the sender's
   preferences (most preferred choice first).

   As of TLS 1.3, servers are permitted to send the "supported_groups"
   extension to the client.  Clients MUST NOT act upon any information
   found in "supported_groups" prior to successful completion of the
   handshake but MAY use the information learned from a successfully
   completed handshake to change what groups they use in their
   "key_share" extension in subsequent connections.  If the server has a
   group it prefers to the ones in the "key_share" extension but is
   still willing to accept the ClientHello, it SHOULD send
   "supported_groups" to update the client's view of its preferences;
   this extension SHOULD contain all groups the server supports,
   regardless of whether they are currently supported by the client.

#### 4.2.8. Key Share

   The "key_share" extension contains the endpoint's cryptographic
   parameters.

   Clients MAY send an empty client_shares vector in order to request
   group selection from the server, at the cost of an additional round
   trip (see Section 4.1.4).

      struct {
          NamedGroup group;
          opaque key_exchange<1..2^16-1>;
      } KeyShareEntry;

   group:  The named group for the key being exchanged.

   key_exchange:  Key exchange information.  The contents of this field
      are determined by the specified group and its corresponding
      definition.  Finite Field Diffie-Hellman [DH76] parameters are
      described in Section 4.2.8.1; Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
      parameters are described in Section 4.2.8.2. 
   In the ClientHello message, the "extension_data" field of this
   extension contains a "KeyShareClientHello" value:

      struct {
          KeyShareEntry client_shares<0..2^16-1>;
      } KeyShareClientHello;

   client_shares:  A list of offered KeyShareEntry values in descending
      order of client preference.

   This vector MAY be empty if the client is requesting a
   HelloRetryRequest.  Each KeyShareEntry value MUST correspond to a
   group offered in the "supported_groups" extension and MUST appear in
   the same order.  However, the values MAY be a non-contiguous subset
   of the "supported_groups" extension and MAY omit the most preferred
   groups.  Such a situation could arise if the most preferred groups
   are new and unlikely to be supported in enough places to make
   pregenerating key shares for them efficient.

   Clients can offer as many KeyShareEntry values as the number of
   supported groups it is offering, each representing a single set of
   key exchange parameters.  For instance, a client might offer shares
   for several elliptic curves or multiple FFDHE groups.  The
   key_exchange values for each KeyShareEntry MUST be generated
   independently.  Clients MUST NOT offer multiple KeyShareEntry values
   for the same group.  Clients MUST NOT offer any KeyShareEntry values
   for groups not listed in the client's "supported_groups" extension.
   Servers MAY check for violations of these rules and abort the
   handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert if one is violated.

   In a HelloRetryRequest message, the "extension_data" field of this
   extension contains a KeyShareHelloRetryRequest value:

      struct {
          NamedGroup selected_group;
      } KeyShareHelloRetryRequest;

   selected_group:  The mutually supported group the server intends to
      negotiate and is requesting a retried ClientHello/KeyShare for.

   Upon receipt of this extension in a HelloRetryRequest, the client
   MUST verify that (1) the selected_group field corresponds to a group
   which was provided in the "supported_groups" extension in the
   original ClientHello and (2) the selected_group field does not
   correspond to a group which was provided in the "key_share" extension
   in the original ClientHello.  If either of these checks fails, then
   the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter"
   alert.  Otherwise, when sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST 
   replace the original "key_share" extension with one containing only a
   new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field
   of the triggering HelloRetryRequest.

   In a ServerHello message, the "extension_data" field of this
   extension contains a KeyShareServerHello value:

      struct {
          KeyShareEntry server_share;
      } KeyShareServerHello;

   server_share:  A single KeyShareEntry value that is in the same group
      as one of the client's shares.

   If using (EC)DHE key establishment, servers offer exactly one
   KeyShareEntry in the ServerHello.  This value MUST be in the same
   group as the KeyShareEntry value offered by the client that the
   server has selected for the negotiated key exchange.  Servers
   MUST NOT send a KeyShareEntry for any group not indicated in the
   client's "supported_groups" extension and MUST NOT send a
   KeyShareEntry when using the "psk_ke" PskKeyExchangeMode.  If using
   (EC)DHE key establishment and a HelloRetryRequest containing a
   "key_share" extension was received by the client, the client MUST
   verify that the selected NamedGroup in the ServerHello is the same as
   that in the HelloRetryRequest.  If this check fails, the client MUST
   abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

##### 4.2.8.1. Diffie-Hellman Parameters

   Diffie-Hellman [DH76] parameters for both clients and servers are
   encoded in the opaque key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in a
   KeyShare structure.  The opaque value contains the Diffie-Hellman
   public value (Y = g^X mod p) for the specified group (see [RFC7919]
   for group definitions) encoded as a big-endian integer and padded to
   the left with zeros to the size of p in bytes.

   Note: For a given Diffie-Hellman group, the padding results in all
   public keys having the same length.

   Peers MUST validate each other's public key Y by ensuring that 1 < Y
   < p-1.  This check ensures that the remote peer is properly behaved
   and isn't forcing the local system into a small subgroup. 





##### 4.2.8.2. ECDHE Parameters

   ECDHE parameters for both clients and servers are encoded in the
   opaque key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in a KeyShare structure.

   For secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1, the contents are the
   serialized value of the following struct:

      struct {
          uint8 legacy_form = 4;
          opaque X[coordinate_length];
          opaque Y[coordinate_length];
      } UncompressedPointRepresentation;

   X and Y, respectively, are the binary representations of the x and y
   values in network byte order.  There are no internal length markers,
   so each number representation occupies as many octets as implied by
   the curve parameters.  For P-256, this means that each of X and Y use
   32 octets, padded on the left by zeros if necessary.  For P-384, they
   take 48 octets each.  For P-521, they take 66 octets each.

   For the curves secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1, peers MUST
   validate each other's public value Q by ensuring that the point is a
   valid point on the elliptic curve.  The appropriate validation
   procedures are defined in Section 4.3.7 of [ECDSA ] and alternatively
   in Section 5.6.2.3 of [KEYAGREEMENT ].  This process consists of three
   steps: (1) verify that Q is not the point at infinity (O), (2) verify
   that for Q = (x, y) both integers x and y are in the correct
   interval, and (3) ensure that (x, y) is a correct solution to the
   elliptic curve equation.  For these curves, implementors do not need
   to verify membership in the correct subgroup.

   For X25519 and X448, the contents of the public value are the byte
   string inputs and outputs of the corresponding functions defined in
   [RFC7748]: 32 bytes for X25519 and 56 bytes for X448.

   Note: Versions of TLS prior to 1.3 permitted point format
   negotiation; TLS 1.3 removes this feature in favor of a single point
   format for each curve.

#### 4.2.9. Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes

   In order to use PSKs, clients MUST also send a
   "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension.  The semantics of this extension
   are that the client only supports the use of PSKs with these modes,
   which restricts both the use of PSKs offered in this ClientHello and
   those which the server might supply via NewSessionTicket. 
   A client MUST provide a "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension if it
   offers a "pre_shared_key" extension.  If clients offer
   "pre_shared_key" without a "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension,
   servers MUST abort the handshake.  Servers MUST NOT select a key
   exchange mode that is not listed by the client.  This extension also
   restricts the modes for use with PSK resumption.  Servers SHOULD NOT
   send NewSessionTicket with tickets that are not compatible with the
   advertised modes; however, if a server does so, the impact will just
   be that the client's attempts at resumption fail.

   The server MUST NOT send a "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension.

      enum { psk_ke(0), psk_dhe_ke(1), (255) } PskKeyExchangeMode;

      struct {
          PskKeyExchangeMode ke_modes<1..255>;
      } PskKeyExchangeModes;

   psk_ke:  PSK-only key establishment.  In this mode, the server
      MUST NOT supply a "key_share" value.

   psk_dhe_ke:  PSK with (EC)DHE key establishment.  In this mode, the
      client and server MUST supply "key_share" values as described in Section 4.2.8.

   Any future values that are allocated must ensure that the transmitted
   protocol messages unambiguously identify which mode was selected by
   the server; at present, this is indicated by the presence of the
   "key_share" in the ServerHello.

#### 4.2.10. Early Data Indication

   When a PSK is used and early data is allowed for that PSK, the client
   can send Application Data in its first flight of messages.  If the
   client opts to do so, it MUST supply both the "pre_shared_key" and
   "early_data" extensions.

   The "extension_data" field of this extension contains an
   "EarlyDataIndication" value. 
      struct {} Empty;

      struct {
          select (Handshake.msg_type) {
              case new_session_ticket:   uint32 max_early_data_size;
              case client_hello:         Empty;
              case encrypted_extensions: Empty;
          };
      } EarlyDataIndication;

   See Section 4.6.1 for details regarding the use of the
   max_early_data_size field.

   The parameters for the 0-RTT data (version, symmetric cipher suite,
   Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) [RFC7301] protocol,
   etc.) are those associated with the PSK in use.  For externally
   provisioned PSKs, the associated values are those provisioned along
   with the key.  For PSKs established via a NewSessionTicket message,
   the associated values are those which were negotiated in the
   connection which established the PSK.  The PSK used to encrypt the
   early data MUST be the first PSK listed in the client's
   "pre_shared_key" extension.

   For PSKs provisioned via NewSessionTicket, a server MUST validate
   that the ticket age for the selected PSK identity (computed by
   subtracting ticket_age_add from PskIdentity.obfuscated_ticket_age
   modulo 2^32) is within a small tolerance of the time since the ticket
   was issued (see Section 8).  If it is not, the server SHOULD proceed
   with the handshake but reject 0-RTT, and SHOULD NOT take any other
   action that assumes that this ClientHello is fresh.

   0-RTT messages sent in the first flight have the same (encrypted)
   content types as messages of the same type sent in other flights
   (handshake and application_data) but are protected under different
   keys.  After receiving the server's Finished message, if the server
   has accepted early data, an EndOfEarlyData message will be sent to
   indicate the key change.  This message will be encrypted with the
   0-RTT traffic keys. 
   A server which receives an "early_data" extension MUST behave in one
   of three ways:

   -  Ignore the extension and return a regular 1-RTT response.  The
      server then skips past early data by attempting to deprotect
      received records using the handshake traffic key, discarding
      records which fail deprotection (up to the configured
      max_early_data_size).  Once a record is deprotected successfully,
      it is treated as the start of the client's second flight and the
      server proceeds as with an ordinary 1-RTT handshake.

   -  Request that the client send another ClientHello by responding
      with a HelloRetryRequest.  A client MUST NOT include the
      "early_data" extension in its followup ClientHello.  The server
      then ignores early data by skipping all records with an external
      content type of "application_data" (indicating that they are
      encrypted), up to the configured max_early_data_size.

   -  Return its own "early_data" extension in EncryptedExtensions,
      indicating that it intends to process the early data.  It is not
      possible for the server to accept only a subset of the early data
      messages.  Even though the server sends a message accepting early
      data, the actual early data itself may already be in flight by the
      time the server generates this message.

   In order to accept early data, the server MUST have accepted a PSK
   cipher suite and selected the first key offered in the client's
   "pre_shared_key" extension.  In addition, it MUST verify that the
   following values are the same as those associated with the
   selected PSK:

   -  The TLS version number

   -  The selected cipher suite

   -  The selected ALPN [RFC7301] protocol, if any

   These requirements are a superset of those needed to perform a 1-RTT
   handshake using the PSK in question.  For externally established
   PSKs, the associated values are those provisioned along with the key.
   For PSKs established via a NewSessionTicket message, the associated
   values are those negotiated in the connection during which the ticket
   was established.

   Future extensions MUST define their interaction with 0-RTT. 
   If any of these checks fail, the server MUST NOT respond with the
   extension and must discard all the first-flight data using one of the
   first two mechanisms listed above (thus falling back to 1-RTT or
   2-RTT).  If the client attempts a 0-RTT handshake but the server
   rejects it, the server will generally not have the 0-RTT record
   protection keys and must instead use trial decryption (either with
   the 1-RTT handshake keys or by looking for a cleartext ClientHello in
   the case of a HelloRetryRequest) to find the first non-0-RTT message.

   If the server chooses to accept the "early_data" extension, then it
   MUST comply with the same error-handling requirements specified for
   all records when processing early data records.  Specifically, if the
   server fails to decrypt a 0-RTT record following an accepted
   "early_data" extension, it MUST terminate the connection with a
   "bad_record_mac" alert as per Section 5.2.

   If the server rejects the "early_data" extension, the client
   application MAY opt to retransmit the Application Data previously
   sent in early data once the handshake has been completed.  Note that
   automatic retransmission of early data could result in incorrect
   assumptions regarding the status of the connection.  For instance,
   when the negotiated connection selects a different ALPN protocol from
   what was used for the early data, an application might need to
   construct different messages.  Similarly, if early data assumes
   anything about the connection state, it might be sent in error after
   the handshake completes.

   A TLS implementation SHOULD NOT automatically resend early data;
   applications are in a better position to decide when retransmission
   is appropriate.  A TLS implementation MUST NOT automatically resend
   early data unless the negotiated connection selects the same ALPN
   protocol.

#### 4.2.11. Pre-Shared Key Extension

   The "pre_shared_key" extension is used to negotiate the identity of
   the pre-shared key to be used with a given handshake in association
   with PSK key establishment. 
   The "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
   "PreSharedKeyExtension" value:

      struct {
          opaque identity<1..2^16-1>;
          uint32 obfuscated_ticket_age;
      } PskIdentity;

      opaque PskBinderEntry<32..255>;

      struct {
          PskIdentity identities<7..2^16-1>;
          PskBinderEntry binders<33..2^16-1>;
      } OfferedPsks;

      struct {
          select (Handshake.msg_type) {
              case client_hello: OfferedPsks;
              case server_hello: uint16 selected_identity;
          };
      } PreSharedKeyExtension;

   identity:  A label for a key.  For instance, a ticket (as defined in Appendix B.3.4) or a label for a pre-shared key established
      externally.

   obfuscated_ticket_age:  An obfuscated version of the age of the key. Section 4.2.11.1 describes how to form this value for identities
      established via the NewSessionTicket message.  For identities
      established externally, an obfuscated_ticket_age of 0 SHOULD be
      used, and servers MUST ignore the value.

   identities:  A list of the identities that the client is willing to
      negotiate with the server.  If sent alongside the "early_data"
      extension (see Section 4.2.10), the first identity is the one used
      for 0-RTT data.

   binders:  A series of HMAC values, one for each value in the
      identities list and in the same order, computed as described
      below.

   selected_identity:  The server's chosen identity expressed as a
      (0-based) index into the identities in the client's list.

   Each PSK is associated with a single Hash algorithm.  For PSKs
   established via the ticket mechanism (Section 4.6.1), this is the KDF
   Hash algorithm on the connection where the ticket was established.
   For externally established PSKs, the Hash algorithm MUST be set when 
   the PSK is established or default to SHA-256 if no such algorithm is
   defined.  The server MUST ensure that it selects a compatible PSK
   (if any) and cipher suite.

   In TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3, the Server Name Identification
   (SNI) value was intended to be associated with the session (Section 3
   of [RFC6066]), with the server being required to enforce that the SNI
   value associated with the session matches the one specified in the
   resumption handshake.  However, in reality the implementations were
   not consistent on which of two supplied SNI values they would use,
   leading to the consistency requirement being de facto enforced by the
   clients.  In TLS 1.3, the SNI value is always explicitly specified in
   the resumption handshake, and there is no need for the server to
   associate an SNI value with the ticket.  Clients, however, SHOULD
   store the SNI with the PSK to fulfill the requirements of Section 4.6.1.

   Implementor's note: When session resumption is the primary use case
   of PSKs, the most straightforward way to implement the PSK/cipher
   suite matching requirements is to negotiate the cipher suite first
   and then exclude any incompatible PSKs.  Any unknown PSKs (e.g., ones
   not in the PSK database or encrypted with an unknown key) SHOULD
   simply be ignored.  If no acceptable PSKs are found, the server
   SHOULD perform a non-PSK handshake if possible.  If backward
   compatibility is important, client-provided, externally established
   PSKs SHOULD influence cipher suite selection.

   Prior to accepting PSK key establishment, the server MUST validate
   the corresponding binder value (see Section 4.2.11.2 below).  If this
   value is not present or does not validate, the server MUST abort the
   handshake.  Servers SHOULD NOT attempt to validate multiple binders;
   rather, they SHOULD select a single PSK and validate solely the
   binder that corresponds to that PSK.  See Section 8.2 and Appendix E.6 for the security rationale for this requirement.  In
   order to accept PSK key establishment, the server sends a
   "pre_shared_key" extension indicating the selected identity.

   Clients MUST verify that the server's selected_identity is within the
   range supplied by the client, that the server selected a cipher suite
   indicating a Hash associated with the PSK, and that a server
   "key_share" extension is present if required by the ClientHello
   "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension.  If these values are not
   consistent, the client MUST abort the handshake with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert. 
   If the server supplies an "early_data" extension, the client MUST
   verify that the server's selected_identity is 0.  If any other value
   is returned, the client MUST abort the handshake with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert.

   The "pre_shared_key" extension MUST be the last extension in the
   ClientHello (this facilitates implementation as described below).
   Servers MUST check that it is the last extension and otherwise fail
   the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

##### 4.2.11.1. Ticket Age

   The client's view of the age of a ticket is the time since the
   receipt of the NewSessionTicket message.  Clients MUST NOT attempt to
   use tickets which have ages greater than the "ticket_lifetime" value
   which was provided with the ticket.  The "obfuscated_ticket_age"
   field of each PskIdentity contains an obfuscated version of the
   ticket age formed by taking the age in milliseconds and adding the
   "ticket_age_add" value that was included with the ticket (see Section 4.6.1), modulo 2^32.  This addition prevents passive
   observers from correlating connections unless tickets are reused.
   Note that the "ticket_lifetime" field in the NewSessionTicket message
   is in seconds but the "obfuscated_ticket_age" is in milliseconds.
   Because ticket lifetimes are restricted to a week, 32 bits is enough
   to represent any plausible age, even in milliseconds.

##### 4.2.11.2. PSK Binder

   The PSK binder value forms a binding between a PSK and the current
   handshake, as well as a binding between the handshake in which the
   PSK was generated (if via a NewSessionTicket message) and the current
   handshake.  Each entry in the binders list is computed as an HMAC
   over a transcript hash (see Section 4.4.1) containing a partial
   ClientHello up to and including the PreSharedKeyExtension.identities
   field.  That is, it includes all of the ClientHello but not the
   binders list itself.  The length fields for the message (including
   the overall length, the length of the extensions block, and the
   length of the "pre_shared_key" extension) are all set as if binders
   of the correct lengths were present.

   The PskBinderEntry is computed in the same way as the Finished
   message (Section 4.4.4) but with the BaseKey being the binder_key
   derived via the key schedule from the corresponding PSK which is
   being offered (see Section 7.1). 
   If the handshake includes a HelloRetryRequest, the initial
   ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest are included in the transcript
   along with the new ClientHello.  For instance, if the client sends
   ClientHello1, its binder will be computed over:

      Transcript-Hash(Truncate(ClientHello1))

   Where Truncate() removes the binders list from the ClientHello.

   If the server responds with a HelloRetryRequest and the client then
   sends ClientHello2, its binder will be computed over:

      Transcript-Hash(ClientHello1,
                      HelloRetryRequest,
                      Truncate(ClientHello2))

   The full ClientHello1/ClientHello2 is included in all other handshake
   hash computations.  Note that in the first flight,
   Truncate(ClientHello1) is hashed directly, but in the second flight,
   ClientHello1 is hashed and then reinjected as a "message_hash"
   message, as described in Section 4.4.1.

##### 4.2.11.3. Processing Order

   Clients are permitted to "stream" 0-RTT data until they receive the
   server's Finished, only then sending the EndOfEarlyData message,
   followed by the rest of the handshake.  In order to avoid deadlocks,
   when accepting "early_data", servers MUST process the client's
   ClientHello and then immediately send their flight of messages,
   rather than waiting for the client's EndOfEarlyData message before
   sending its ServerHello.

### 4.3. Server Parameters

   The next two messages from the server, EncryptedExtensions and
   CertificateRequest, contain information from the server that
   determines the rest of the handshake.  These messages are encrypted
   with keys derived from the server_handshake_traffic_secret. 





#### 4.3.1. Encrypted Extensions

   In all handshakes, the server MUST send the EncryptedExtensions
   message immediately after the ServerHello message.  This is the first
   message that is encrypted under keys derived from the
   server_handshake_traffic_secret.

   The EncryptedExtensions message contains extensions that can be
   protected, i.e., any which are not needed to establish the
   cryptographic context but which are not associated with individual
   certificates.  The client MUST check EncryptedExtensions for the
   presence of any forbidden extensions and if any are found MUST abort
   the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
      } EncryptedExtensions;

   extensions:  A list of extensions.  For more information, see the
      table in Section 4.2.

#### 4.3.2. Certificate Request

   A server which is authenticating with a certificate MAY optionally
   request a certificate from the client.  This message, if sent, MUST
   follow EncryptedExtensions.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
          Extension extensions<2..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateRequest;
   certificate_request_context:  An opaque string which identifies the
      certificate request and which will be echoed in the client's
      Certificate message.  The certificate_request_context MUST be
      unique within the scope of this connection (thus preventing replay
      of client CertificateVerify messages).  This field SHALL be zero
      length unless used for the post-handshake authentication exchanges
      described in Section 4.6.2.  When requesting post-handshake
      authentication, the server SHOULD make the context unpredictable
      to the client (e.g., by randomly generating it) in order to
      prevent an attacker who has temporary access to the client's
      private key from pre-computing valid CertificateVerify messages.

   extensions:  A set of extensions describing the parameters of the
      certificate being requested.  The "signature_algorithms" extension
      MUST be specified, and other extensions may optionally be included
      if defined for this message.  Clients MUST ignore unrecognized
      extensions.

   In prior versions of TLS, the CertificateRequest message carried a
   list of signature algorithms and certificate authorities which the
   server would accept.  In TLS 1.3, the former is expressed by sending
   the "signature_algorithms" and optionally "signature_algorithms_cert"
   extensions.  The latter is expressed by sending the
   "certificate_authorities" extension (see Section 4.2.4).

   Servers which are authenticating with a PSK MUST NOT send the
   CertificateRequest message in the main handshake, though they MAY
   send it in post-handshake authentication (see Section 4.6.2) provided
   that the client has sent the "post_handshake_auth" extension (see Section 4.2.6).

### 4.4. Authentication Messages

   As discussed in Section 2, TLS generally uses a common set of
   messages for authentication, key confirmation, and handshake
   integrity: Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished.  (The PSK
   binders also perform key confirmation, in a similar fashion.)  These
   three messages are always sent as the last messages in their
   handshake flight.  The Certificate and CertificateVerify messages are
   only sent under certain circumstances, as defined below.  The
   Finished message is always sent as part of the Authentication Block.
   These messages are encrypted under keys derived from the
   [sender ]_handshake_traffic_secret. 
   The computations for the Authentication messages all uniformly take
   the following inputs:

   -  The certificate and signing key to be used.

   -  A Handshake Context consisting of the set of messages to be
      included in the transcript hash.

   -  A Base Key to be used to compute a MAC key.

   Based on these inputs, the messages then contain:

   Certificate:  The certificate to be used for authentication, and any
      supporting certificates in the chain.  Note that certificate-based
      client authentication is not available in PSK handshake flows
      (including 0-RTT).

   CertificateVerify:  A signature over the value
      Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context, Certificate).

   Finished:  A MAC over the value Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context,
      Certificate, CertificateVerify) using a MAC key derived from the
      Base Key.

   The following table defines the Handshake Context and MAC Base Key
   for each scenario:

   +-----------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Mode      | Handshake Context       | Base Key                    |
   +-----------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Server    | ClientHello ... later   | server_handshake_traffic_   |
   |           | of EncryptedExtensions/ | secret                      |
   |           | CertificateRequest      |                             |
   |           |                         |                             |
   | Client    | ClientHello ... later   | client_handshake_traffic_   |
   |           | of server               | secret                      |
   |           | Finished/EndOfEarlyData |                             |
   |           |                         |                             |
   | Post-     | ClientHello ... client  | client_application_traffic_ |
   | Handshake | Finished +              | secret_N                    |
   |           | CertificateRequest      |                             |
   +-----------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+





#### 4.4.1. The Transcript Hash

   Many of the cryptographic computations in TLS make use of a
   transcript hash.  This value is computed by hashing the concatenation
   of each included handshake message, including the handshake message
   header carrying the handshake message type and length fields, but not
   including record layer headers.  I.e.,

    Transcript-Hash(M1, M2, ... Mn) = Hash(M1 || M2 || ... || Mn)

   As an exception to this general rule, when the server responds to a
   ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest, the value of ClientHello1 is
   replaced with a special synthetic handshake message of handshake type
   "message_hash" containing Hash(ClientHello1).  I.e.,

  Transcript-Hash(ClientHello1, HelloRetryRequest, ... Mn) =
      Hash(message_hash ||        /* Handshake type */
           00 00 Hash.length  ||  /* Handshake message length (bytes) */
           Hash(ClientHello1) ||  /* Hash of ClientHello1 */
           HelloRetryRequest  || ... || Mn)

   The reason for this construction is to allow the server to do a
   stateless HelloRetryRequest by storing just the hash of ClientHello1
   in the cookie, rather than requiring it to export the entire
   intermediate hash state (see Section 4.2.2).

   For concreteness, the transcript hash is always taken from the
   following sequence of handshake messages, starting at the first
   ClientHello and including only those messages that were sent:
   ClientHello, HelloRetryRequest, ClientHello, ServerHello,
   EncryptedExtensions, server CertificateRequest, server Certificate,
   server CertificateVerify, server Finished, EndOfEarlyData, client
   Certificate, client CertificateVerify, client Finished.

   In general, implementations can implement the transcript by keeping a
   running transcript hash value based on the negotiated hash.  Note,
   however, that subsequent post-handshake authentications do not
   include each other, just the messages through the end of the main
   handshake. 





#### 4.4.2. Certificate

   This message conveys the endpoint's certificate chain to the peer.

   The server MUST send a Certificate message whenever the agreed-upon
   key exchange method uses certificates for authentication (this
   includes all key exchange methods defined in this document
   except PSK).

   The client MUST send a Certificate message if and only if the server
   has requested client authentication via a CertificateRequest message
   (Section 4.3.2).  If the server requests client authentication but no
   suitable certificate is available, the client MUST send a Certificate
   message containing no certificates (i.e., with the "certificate_list"
   field having length 0).  A Finished message MUST be sent regardless
   of whether the Certificate message is empty.

   Structure of this message:

      enum {
          X509(0),
          RawPublicKey(2),
          (255)
      } CertificateType;

      struct {
          select (certificate_type) {
              case RawPublicKey:
                /* From RFC 7250 ASN.1_subjectPublicKeyInfo */
                opaque ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;

              case X509:
                opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;
          };
          Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateEntry;

      struct {
          opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
          CertificateEntry certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
      } Certificate;
   certificate_request_context:  If this message is in response to a
      CertificateRequest, the value of certificate_request_context in
      that message.  Otherwise (in the case of server authentication),
      this field SHALL be zero length.

   certificate_list:  A sequence (chain) of CertificateEntry structures,
      each containing a single certificate and set of extensions.

   extensions:  A set of extension values for the CertificateEntry.  The
      "Extension" format is defined in Section 4.2.  Valid extensions
      for server certificates at present include the OCSP Status
      extension [RFC6066] and the SignedCertificateTimestamp extension
      [RFC6962]; future extensions may be defined for this message as
      well.  Extensions in the Certificate message from the server MUST
      correspond to ones from the ClientHello message.  Extensions in
      the Certificate message from the client MUST correspond to
      extensions in the CertificateRequest message from the server.  If
      an extension applies to the entire chain, it SHOULD be included in
      the first CertificateEntry.

   If the corresponding certificate type extension
   ("server_certificate_type" or "client_certificate_type") was not
   negotiated in EncryptedExtensions, or the X.509 certificate type was
   negotiated, then each CertificateEntry contains a DER-encoded X.509
   certificate.  The sender's certificate MUST come in the first
   CertificateEntry in the list.  Each following certificate SHOULD
   directly certify the one immediately preceding it.  Because
   certificate validation requires that trust anchors be distributed
   independently, a certificate that specifies a trust anchor MAY be
   omitted from the chain, provided that supported peers are known to
   possess any omitted certificates.

   Note: Prior to TLS 1.3, "certificate_list" ordering required each
   certificate to certify the one immediately preceding it; however,
   some implementations allowed some flexibility.  Servers sometimes
   send both a current and deprecated intermediate for transitional
   purposes, and others are simply configured incorrectly, but these
   cases can nonetheless be validated properly.  For maximum
   compatibility, all implementations SHOULD be prepared to handle
   potentially extraneous certificates and arbitrary orderings from any
   TLS version, with the exception of the end-entity certificate which
   MUST be first.

   If the RawPublicKey certificate type was negotiated, then the
   certificate_list MUST contain no more than one CertificateEntry,
   which contains an ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo value as defined in [RFC7250], Section 3. 
   The OpenPGP certificate type [RFC6091] MUST NOT be used with TLS 1.3.

   The server's certificate_list MUST always be non-empty.  A client
   will send an empty certificate_list if it does not have an
   appropriate certificate to send in response to the server's
   authentication request.

##### 4.4.2.1. OCSP Status and SCT Extensions

   [RFC6066] and [RFC6961] provide extensions to negotiate the server
   sending OCSP responses to the client.  In TLS 1.2 and below, the
   server replies with an empty extension to indicate negotiation of
   this extension and the OCSP information is carried in a
   CertificateStatus message.  In TLS 1.3, the server's OCSP information
   is carried in an extension in the CertificateEntry containing the
   associated certificate.  Specifically, the body of the
   "status_request" extension from the server MUST be a
   CertificateStatus structure as defined in [RFC6066], which is
   interpreted as defined in [RFC6960].

   Note: The status_request_v2 extension [RFC6961] is deprecated.
   TLS 1.3 servers MUST NOT act upon its presence or information in it
   when processing ClientHello messages; in particular, they MUST NOT
   send the status_request_v2 extension in the EncryptedExtensions,
   CertificateRequest, or Certificate messages.  TLS 1.3 servers MUST be
   able to process ClientHello messages that include it, as it MAY be
   sent by clients that wish to use it in earlier protocol versions.

   A server MAY request that a client present an OCSP response with its
   certificate by sending an empty "status_request" extension in its
   CertificateRequest message.  If the client opts to send an OCSP
   response, the body of its "status_request" extension MUST be a
   CertificateStatus structure as defined in [RFC6066].

   Similarly, [RFC6962] provides a mechanism for a server to send a
   Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) as an extension in the ServerHello
   in TLS 1.2 and below.  In TLS 1.3, the server's SCT information is
   carried in an extension in the CertificateEntry. 





##### 4.4.2.2. Server Certificate Selection

   The following rules apply to the certificates sent by the server:

   -  The certificate type MUST be X.509v3 [RFC5280], unless explicitly
      negotiated otherwise (e.g., [RFC7250]).

   -  The server's end-entity certificate's public key (and associated
      restrictions) MUST be compatible with the selected authentication
      algorithm from the client's "signature_algorithms" extension
      (currently RSA, ECDSA, or EdDSA).

   -  The certificate MUST allow the key to be used for signing (i.e.,
      the digitalSignature bit MUST be set if the Key Usage extension is
      present) with a signature scheme indicated in the client's
      "signature_algorithms"/"signature_algorithms_cert" extensions (see Section 4.2.3).

   -  The "server_name" [RFC6066] and "certificate_authorities"
      extensions are used to guide certificate selection.  As servers
      MAY require the presence of the "server_name" extension, clients
      SHOULD send this extension, when applicable.

   All certificates provided by the server MUST be signed by a signature
   algorithm advertised by the client if it is able to provide such a
   chain (see Section 4.2.3).  Certificates that are self-signed or
   certificates that are expected to be trust anchors are not validated
   as part of the chain and therefore MAY be signed with any algorithm.

   If the server cannot produce a certificate chain that is signed only
   via the indicated supported algorithms, then it SHOULD continue the
   handshake by sending the client a certificate chain of its choice
   that may include algorithms that are not known to be supported by the
   client.  This fallback chain SHOULD NOT use the deprecated SHA-1 hash
   algorithm in general, but MAY do so if the client's advertisement
   permits it, and MUST NOT do so otherwise.

   If the client cannot construct an acceptable chain using the provided
   certificates and decides to abort the handshake, then it MUST abort
   the handshake with an appropriate certificate-related alert (by
   default, "unsupported_certificate"; see Section 6.2 for more
   information).

   If the server has multiple certificates, it chooses one of them based
   on the above-mentioned criteria (in addition to other criteria, such
   as transport-layer endpoint, local configuration, and preferences). 





##### 4.4.2.3. Client Certificate Selection

   The following rules apply to certificates sent by the client:

   -  The certificate type MUST be X.509v3 [RFC5280], unless explicitly
      negotiated otherwise (e.g., [RFC7250]).

   -  If the "certificate_authorities" extension in the
      CertificateRequest message was present, at least one of the
      certificates in the certificate chain SHOULD be issued by one of
      the listed CAs.

   -  The certificates MUST be signed using an acceptable signature
      algorithm, as described in Section 4.3.2.  Note that this relaxes
      the constraints on certificate-signing algorithms found in prior
      versions of TLS.

   -  If the CertificateRequest message contained a non-empty
      "oid_filters" extension, the end-entity certificate MUST match the
      extension OIDs that are recognized by the client, as described in Section 4.2.5.

##### 4.4.2.4. Receiving a Certificate Message

   In general, detailed certificate validation procedures are out of
   scope for TLS (see [RFC5280]).  This section provides TLS-specific
   requirements.

   If the server supplies an empty Certificate message, the client MUST
   abort the handshake with a "decode_error" alert.

   If the client does not send any certificates (i.e., it sends an empty
   Certificate message), the server MAY at its discretion either
   continue the handshake without client authentication or abort the
   handshake with a "certificate_required" alert.  Also, if some aspect
   of the certificate chain was unacceptable (e.g., it was not signed by
   a known, trusted CA), the server MAY at its discretion either
   continue the handshake (considering the client unauthenticated) or
   abort the handshake.

   Any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to
   validate using any signature algorithm using an MD5 hash MUST abort
   the handshake with a "bad_certificate" alert.  SHA-1 is deprecated,
   and it is RECOMMENDED that any endpoint receiving any certificate
   which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using a
   SHA-1 hash abort the handshake with a "bad_certificate" alert.  For
   clarity, this means that endpoints can accept these algorithms for
   certificates that are self-signed or are trust anchors. 
   All endpoints are RECOMMENDED to transition to SHA-256 or better as
   soon as possible to maintain interoperability with implementations
   currently in the process of phasing out SHA-1 support.

   Note that a certificate containing a key for one signature algorithm
   MAY be signed using a different signature algorithm (for instance, an
   RSA key signed with an ECDSA key).

#### 4.4.3. Certificate Verify

   This message is used to provide explicit proof that an endpoint
   possesses the private key corresponding to its certificate.  The
   CertificateVerify message also provides integrity for the handshake
   up to this point.  Servers MUST send this message when authenticating
   via a certificate.  Clients MUST send this message whenever
   authenticating via a certificate (i.e., when the Certificate message
   is non-empty).  When sent, this message MUST appear immediately after
   the Certificate message and immediately prior to the Finished
   message.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          SignatureScheme algorithm;
          opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
      } CertificateVerify;

   The algorithm field specifies the signature algorithm used (see Section 4.2.3 for the definition of this type).  The signature is a
   digital signature using that algorithm.  The content that is covered
   under the signature is the hash output as described in Section 4.4.1,
   namely:

      Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context, Certificate)

   The digital signature is then computed over the concatenation of:

   -  A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times

   -  The context string

   -  A single 0 byte which serves as the separator

   -  The content to be signed 
   This structure is intended to prevent an attack on previous versions
   of TLS in which the ServerKeyExchange format meant that attackers
   could obtain a signature of a message with a chosen 32-byte prefix
   (ClientHello.random).  The initial 64-byte pad clears that prefix
   along with the server-controlled ServerHello.random.

   The context string for a server signature is
   "TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify".  The context string for a
   client signature is "TLS 1.3, client CertificateVerify".  It is
   used to provide separation between signatures made in different
   contexts, helping against potential cross-protocol attacks.

   For example, if the transcript hash was 32 bytes of 01 (this length
   would make sense for SHA-256), the content covered by the digital
   signature for a server CertificateVerify would be:

      2020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020
      2020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020
      544c5320312e332c207365727665722043657274696669636174655665726966
      79
      00
      0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101

   On the sender side, the process for computing the signature field of
   the CertificateVerify message takes as input:

   -  The content covered by the digital signature

   -  The private signing key corresponding to the certificate sent in
      the previous message

   If the CertificateVerify message is sent by a server, the signature
   algorithm MUST be one offered in the client's "signature_algorithms"
   extension unless no valid certificate chain can be produced without
   unsupported algorithms (see Section 4.2.3).

   If sent by a client, the signature algorithm used in the signature
   MUST be one of those present in the supported_signature_algorithms
   field of the "signature_algorithms" extension in the
   CertificateRequest message.

   In addition, the signature algorithm MUST be compatible with the key
   in the sender's end-entity certificate.  RSA signatures MUST use an
   RSASSA-PSS algorithm, regardless of whether RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   algorithms appear in "signature_algorithms".  The SHA-1 algorithm
   MUST NOT be used in any signatures of CertificateVerify messages. 
   All SHA-1 signature algorithms in this specification are defined
   solely for use in legacy certificates and are not valid for
   CertificateVerify signatures.

   The receiver of a CertificateVerify message MUST verify the signature
   field.  The verification process takes as input:

   -  The content covered by the digital signature

   -  The public key contained in the end-entity certificate found in
      the associated Certificate message

   -  The digital signature received in the signature field of the
      CertificateVerify message

   If the verification fails, the receiver MUST terminate the handshake
   with a "decrypt_error" alert.

#### 4.4.4. Finished

   The Finished message is the final message in the Authentication
   Block.  It is essential for providing authentication of the handshake
   and of the computed keys.

   Recipients of Finished messages MUST verify that the contents are
   correct and if incorrect MUST terminate the connection with a
   "decrypt_error" alert.

   Once a side has sent its Finished message and has received and
   validated the Finished message from its peer, it may begin to send
   and receive Application Data over the connection.  There are two
   settings in which it is permitted to send data prior to receiving the
   peer's Finished:

   1.  Clients sending 0-RTT data as described in Section 4.2.10.

   2.  Servers MAY send data after sending their first flight, but
       because the handshake is not yet complete, they have no assurance
       of either the peer's identity or its liveness (i.e., the
       ClientHello might have been replayed). 
   The key used to compute the Finished message is computed from the
   Base Key defined in Section 4.4 using HKDF (see Section 7.1).
   Specifically:

   finished_key =
       HKDF-Expand-Label(BaseKey, "finished", "", Hash.length)

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          opaque verify_data[Hash.length];
      } Finished;

   The verify_data value is computed as follows:

      verify_data =
          HMAC(finished_key,
               Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context,
                               Certificate*, CertificateVerify*))

      * Only included if present.

   HMAC [RFC2104] uses the Hash algorithm for the handshake.  As noted
   above, the HMAC input can generally be implemented by a running hash,
   i.e., just the handshake hash at this point.

   In previous versions of TLS, the verify_data was always 12 octets
   long.  In TLS 1.3, it is the size of the HMAC output for the Hash
   used for the handshake.

   Note: Alerts and any other non-handshake record types are not
   handshake messages and are not included in the hash computations.

   Any records following a Finished message MUST be encrypted under the
   appropriate application traffic key as described in Section 7.2.  In
   particular, this includes any alerts sent by the server in response
   to client Certificate and CertificateVerify messages.

### 4.5. End of Early Data

      struct {} EndOfEarlyData;

   If the server sent an "early_data" extension in EncryptedExtensions,
   the client MUST send an EndOfEarlyData message after receiving the
   server Finished.  If the server does not send an "early_data"
   extension in EncryptedExtensions, then the client MUST NOT send an
   EndOfEarlyData message.  This message indicates that all 0-RTT
   application_data messages, if any, have been transmitted and that the 
   following records are protected under handshake traffic keys.
   Servers MUST NOT send this message, and clients receiving it MUST
   terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.  This
   message is encrypted under keys derived from the
   client_early_traffic_secret.

### 4.6. Post-Handshake Messages

   TLS also allows other messages to be sent after the main handshake.
   These messages use a handshake content type and are encrypted under
   the appropriate application traffic key.

#### 4.6.1. New Session Ticket Message

   At any time after the server has received the client Finished
   message, it MAY send a NewSessionTicket message.  This message
   creates a unique association between the ticket value and a secret
   PSK derived from the resumption master secret (see Section 7).

   The client MAY use this PSK for future handshakes by including the
   ticket value in the "pre_shared_key" extension in its ClientHello
   (Section 4.2.11).  Servers MAY send multiple tickets on a single
   connection, either immediately after each other or after specific
   events (see Appendix C.4).  For instance, the server might send a new
   ticket after post-handshake authentication in order to encapsulate
   the additional client authentication state.  Multiple tickets are
   useful for clients for a variety of purposes, including:

   -  Opening multiple parallel HTTP connections.

   -  Performing connection racing across interfaces and address
      families via (for example) Happy Eyeballs [RFC8305] or related
      techniques.

   Any ticket MUST only be resumed with a cipher suite that has the same
   KDF hash algorithm as that used to establish the original connection.

   Clients MUST only resume if the new SNI value is valid for the server
   certificate presented in the original session and SHOULD only resume
   if the SNI value matches the one used in the original session.  The
   latter is a performance optimization: normally, there is no reason to
   expect that different servers covered by a single certificate would
   be able to accept each other's tickets; hence, attempting resumption
   in that case would waste a single-use ticket.  If such an indication
   is provided (externally or by any other means), clients MAY resume
   with a different SNI value. 
   On resumption, if reporting an SNI value to the calling application,
   implementations MUST use the value sent in the resumption ClientHello
   rather than the value sent in the previous session.  Note that if a
   server implementation declines all PSK identities with different SNI
   values, these two values are always the same.

   Note: Although the resumption master secret depends on the client's
   second flight, a server which does not request client authentication
   MAY compute the remainder of the transcript independently and then
   send a NewSessionTicket immediately upon sending its Finished rather
   than waiting for the client Finished.  This might be appropriate in
   cases where the client is expected to open multiple TLS connections
   in parallel and would benefit from the reduced overhead of a
   resumption handshake, for example.

      struct {
          uint32 ticket_lifetime;
          uint32 ticket_age_add;
          opaque ticket_nonce<0..255>;
          opaque ticket<1..2^16-1>;
          Extension extensions<0..2^16-2>;
      } NewSessionTicket;

   ticket_lifetime:  Indicates the lifetime in seconds as a 32-bit
      unsigned integer in network byte order from the time of ticket
      issuance.  Servers MUST NOT use any value greater than
      604800 seconds (7 days).  The value of zero indicates that the
      ticket should be discarded immediately.  Clients MUST NOT cache
      tickets for longer than 7 days, regardless of the ticket_lifetime,
      and MAY delete tickets earlier based on local policy.  A server
      MAY treat a ticket as valid for a shorter period of time than what
      is stated in the ticket_lifetime.

   ticket_age_add:  A securely generated, random 32-bit value that is
      used to obscure the age of the ticket that the client includes in
      the "pre_shared_key" extension.  The client-side ticket age is
      added to this value modulo 2^32 to obtain the value that is
      transmitted by the client.  The server MUST generate a fresh value
      for each ticket it sends.

   ticket_nonce:  A per-ticket value that is unique across all tickets
      issued on this connection. 
   ticket:  The value of the ticket to be used as the PSK identity.  The
      ticket itself is an opaque label.  It MAY be either a database
      lookup key or a self-encrypted and self-authenticated value.

   extensions:  A set of extension values for the ticket.  The
      "Extension" format is defined in Section 4.2.  Clients MUST ignore
      unrecognized extensions.

   The sole extension currently defined for NewSessionTicket is
   "early_data", indicating that the ticket may be used to send 0-RTT
   data (Section 4.2.10).  It contains the following value:

   max_early_data_size:  The maximum amount of 0-RTT data that the
      client is allowed to send when using this ticket, in bytes.  Only
      Application Data payload (i.e., plaintext but not padding or the
      inner content type byte) is counted.  A server receiving more than
      max_early_data_size bytes of 0-RTT data SHOULD terminate the
      connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.  Note that servers
      that reject early data due to lack of cryptographic material will
      be unable to differentiate padding from content, so clients
      SHOULD NOT depend on being able to send large quantities of
      padding in early data records.

   The PSK associated with the ticket is computed as:

       HKDF-Expand-Label(resumption_master_secret,
                        "resumption", ticket_nonce, Hash.length)

   Because the ticket_nonce value is distinct for each NewSessionTicket
   message, a different PSK will be derived for each ticket.

   Note that in principle it is possible to continue issuing new tickets
   which indefinitely extend the lifetime of the keying material
   originally derived from an initial non-PSK handshake (which was most
   likely tied to the peer's certificate).  It is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations place limits on the total lifetime of such keying
   material; these limits should take into account the lifetime of the
   peer's certificate, the likelihood of intervening revocation, and the
   time since the peer's online CertificateVerify signature.

#### 4.6.2. Post-Handshake Authentication

   When the client has sent the "post_handshake_auth" extension (see Section 4.2.6), a server MAY request client authentication at any
   time after the handshake has completed by sending a
   CertificateRequest message.  The client MUST respond with the
   appropriate Authentication messages (see Section 4.4).  If the client
   chooses to authenticate, it MUST send Certificate, CertificateVerify,
   and Finished.  If it declines, it MUST send a Certificate message
   containing no certificates followed by Finished.  All of the client's
   messages for a given response MUST appear consecutively on the wire
   with no intervening messages of other types.

   A client that receives a CertificateRequest message without having
   sent the "post_handshake_auth" extension MUST send an
   "unexpected_message" fatal alert.

   Note: Because client authentication could involve prompting the user,
   servers MUST be prepared for some delay, including receiving an
   arbitrary number of other messages between sending the
   CertificateRequest and receiving a response.  In addition, clients
   which receive multiple CertificateRequests in close succession MAY
   respond to them in a different order than they were received (the
   certificate_request_context value allows the server to disambiguate
   the responses).

#### 4.6.3. Key and Initialization Vector Update

   The KeyUpdate handshake message is used to indicate that the sender
   is updating its sending cryptographic keys.  This message can be sent
   by either peer after it has sent a Finished message.  Implementations
   that receive a KeyUpdate message prior to receiving a Finished
   message MUST terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message"
   alert.  After sending a KeyUpdate message, the sender SHALL send all
   its traffic using the next generation of keys, computed as described
   in Section 7.2.  Upon receiving a KeyUpdate, the receiver MUST update
   its receiving keys.

      enum {
          update_not_requested(0), update_requested(1), (255)
      } KeyUpdateRequest;

      struct {
          KeyUpdateRequest request_update;
      } KeyUpdate;

   request_update:  Indicates whether the recipient of the KeyUpdate
      should respond with its own KeyUpdate.  If an implementation
      receives any other value, it MUST terminate the connection with an
      "illegal_parameter" alert.

   If the request_update field is set to "update_requested", then the
   receiver MUST send a KeyUpdate of its own with request_update set to
   "update_not_requested" prior to sending its next Application Data
   record.  This mechanism allows either side to force an update to the
   entire connection, but causes an implementation which receives 
   multiple KeyUpdates while it is silent to respond with a single
   update.  Note that implementations may receive an arbitrary number of
   messages between sending a KeyUpdate with request_update set to
   "update_requested" and receiving the peer's KeyUpdate, because those
   messages may already be in flight.  However, because send and receive
   keys are derived from independent traffic secrets, retaining the
   receive traffic secret does not threaten the forward secrecy of data
   sent before the sender changed keys.

   If implementations independently send their own KeyUpdates with
   request_update set to "update_requested" and they cross in flight,
   then each side will also send a response, with the result that each
   side increments by two generations.

   Both sender and receiver MUST encrypt their KeyUpdate messages with
   the old keys.  Additionally, both sides MUST enforce that a KeyUpdate
   with the old key is received before accepting any messages encrypted
   with the new key.  Failure to do so may allow message truncation
   attacks.

## 5. Record Protocol

   The TLS record protocol takes messages to be transmitted, fragments
   the data into manageable blocks, protects the records, and transmits
   the result.  Received data is verified, decrypted, reassembled, and
   then delivered to higher-level clients.

   TLS records are typed, which allows multiple higher-level protocols
   to be multiplexed over the same record layer.  This document
   specifies four content types: handshake, application_data, alert, and
   change_cipher_spec.  The change_cipher_spec record is used only for
   compatibility purposes (see Appendix D.4).

   An implementation may receive an unencrypted record of type
   change_cipher_spec consisting of the single byte value 0x01 at any
   time after the first ClientHello message has been sent or received
   and before the peer's Finished message has been received and MUST
   simply drop it without further processing.  Note that this record may
   appear at a point at the handshake where the implementation is
   expecting protected records, and so it is necessary to detect this
   condition prior to attempting to deprotect the record.  An
   implementation which receives any other change_cipher_spec value or
   which receives a protected change_cipher_spec record MUST abort the
   handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert.  If an implementation
   detects a change_cipher_spec record received before the first
   ClientHello message or after the peer's Finished message, it MUST be
   treated as an unexpected record type (though stateless servers may
   not be able to distinguish these cases from allowed cases). 
   Implementations MUST NOT send record types not defined in this
   document unless negotiated by some extension.  If a TLS
   implementation receives an unexpected record type, it MUST terminate
   the connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.  New record
   content type values are assigned by IANA in the TLS ContentType
   registry as described in Section 11.

### 5.1. Record Layer

   The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext
   records carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less.  Message
   boundaries are handled differently depending on the underlying
   ContentType.  Any future content types MUST specify appropriate
   rules.  Note that these rules are stricter than what was enforced in
   TLS 1.2.

   Handshake messages MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record
   or fragmented across several records, provided that:

   -  Handshake messages MUST NOT be interleaved with other record
      types.  That is, if a handshake message is split over two or more
      records, there MUST NOT be any other records between them.

   -  Handshake messages MUST NOT span key changes.  Implementations
      MUST verify that all messages immediately preceding a key change
      align with a record boundary; if not, then they MUST terminate the
      connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.  Because the
      ClientHello, EndOfEarlyData, ServerHello, Finished, and KeyUpdate
      messages can immediately precede a key change, implementations
      MUST send these messages in alignment with a record boundary.

   Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake
   types, even if those fragments contain padding.

   Alert messages (Section 6) MUST NOT be fragmented across records, and
   multiple alert messages MUST NOT be coalesced into a single
   TLSPlaintext record.  In other words, a record with an Alert type
   MUST contain exactly one message.

   Application Data messages contain data that is opaque to TLS.
   Application Data messages are always protected.  Zero-length
   fragments of Application Data MAY be sent, as they are potentially
   useful as a traffic analysis countermeasure.  Application Data
   fragments MAY be split across multiple records or coalesced into a
   single record. 
      enum {
          invalid(0),
          change_cipher_spec(20),
          alert(21),
          handshake(22),
          application_data(23),
          (255)
      } ContentType;

      struct {
          ContentType type;
          ProtocolVersion legacy_record_version;
          uint16 length;
          opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
      } TLSPlaintext;

   type:  The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed
      fragment.

   legacy_record_version:  MUST be set to 0x0303 for all records
      generated by a TLS 1.3 implementation other than an initial
      ClientHello (i.e., one not generated after a HelloRetryRequest),
      where it MAY also be 0x0301 for compatibility purposes.  This
      field is deprecated and MUST be ignored for all purposes.
      Previous versions of TLS would use other values in this field
      under some circumstances.

   length:  The length (in bytes) of the following
      TLSPlaintext.fragment.  The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 bytes.  An
      endpoint that receives a record that exceeds this length MUST
      terminate the connection with a "record_overflow" alert.

   fragment:  The data being transmitted.  This value is transparent and
      is treated as an independent block to be dealt with by the higher-
      level protocol specified by the type field.

   This document describes TLS 1.3, which uses the version 0x0304.  This
   version value is historical, deriving from the use of 0x0301 for
   TLS 1.0 and 0x0300 for SSL 3.0.  In order to maximize backward
   compatibility, a record containing an initial ClientHello SHOULD have
   version 0x0301 (reflecting TLS 1.0) and a record containing a second
   ClientHello or a ServerHello MUST have version 0x0303 (reflecting
   TLS 1.2).  When negotiating prior versions of TLS, endpoints follow
   the procedure and requirements provided in Appendix D . 
   When record protection has not yet been engaged, TLSPlaintext
   structures are written directly onto the wire.  Once record
   protection has started, TLSPlaintext records are protected and sent
   as described in the following section.  Note that Application Data
   records MUST NOT be written to the wire unprotected (see Section 2   for details).

### 5.2. Record Payload Protection

   The record protection functions translate a TLSPlaintext structure
   into a TLSCiphertext structure.  The deprotection functions reverse
   the process.  In TLS 1.3, as opposed to previous versions of TLS, all
   ciphers are modeled as "Authenticated Encryption with Associated
   Data" (AEAD) [RFC5116].  AEAD functions provide a unified encryption
   and authentication operation which turns plaintext into authenticated
   ciphertext and back again.  Each encrypted record consists of a
   plaintext header followed by an encrypted body, which itself contains
   a type and optional padding.

      struct {
          opaque content[TLSPlaintext.length];
          ContentType type;
          uint8 zeros[length_of_padding];
      } TLSInnerPlaintext;

      struct {
          ContentType opaque_type = application_data; /* 23 */
          ProtocolVersion legacy_record_version = 0x0303; /* TLS v1.2 */
          uint16 length;
          opaque encrypted_record[TLSCiphertext.length];
      } TLSCiphertext;

   content:  The TLSPlaintext.fragment value, containing the byte
      encoding of a handshake or an alert message, or the raw bytes of
      the application's data to send.

   type:  The TLSPlaintext.type value containing the content type of the
      record.

   zeros:  An arbitrary-length run of zero-valued bytes may appear in
      the cleartext after the type field.  This provides an opportunity
      for senders to pad any TLS record by a chosen amount as long as
      the total stays within record size limits.  See Section 5.4 for
      more details. 
   opaque_type:  The outer opaque_type field of a TLSCiphertext record
      is always set to the value 23 (application_data) for outward
      compatibility with middleboxes accustomed to parsing previous
      versions of TLS.  The actual content type of the record is found
      in TLSInnerPlaintext.type after decryption.

   legacy_record_version:  The legacy_record_version field is always
      0x0303.  TLS 1.3 TLSCiphertexts are not generated until after
      TLS 1.3 has been negotiated, so there are no historical
      compatibility concerns where other values might be received.  Note
      that the handshake protocol, including the ClientHello and
      ServerHello messages, authenticates the protocol version, so this
      value is redundant.

   length:  The length (in bytes) of the following
      TLSCiphertext.encrypted_record, which is the sum of the lengths of
      the content and the padding, plus one for the inner content type,
      plus any expansion added by the AEAD algorithm.  The length
      MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 256 bytes.  An endpoint that receives a
      record that exceeds this length MUST terminate the connection with
      a "record_overflow" alert.

   encrypted_record:  The AEAD-encrypted form of the serialized
      TLSInnerPlaintext structure.

   AEAD algorithms take as input a single key, a nonce, a plaintext, and
   "additional data" to be included in the authentication check, as
   described in Section 2.1 of [RFC5116].  The key is either the
   client_write_key or the server_write_key, the nonce is derived from
   the sequence number and the client_write_iv or server_write_iv (see Section 5.3), and the additional data input is the record header.

   I.e.,

      additional_data = TLSCiphertext.opaque_type ||
                        TLSCiphertext.legacy_record_version ||
                        TLSCiphertext.length

   The plaintext input to the AEAD algorithm is the encoded
   TLSInnerPlaintext structure.  Derivation of traffic keys is defined
   in Section 7.3.

   The AEAD output consists of the ciphertext output from the AEAD
   encryption operation.  The length of the plaintext is greater than
   the corresponding TLSPlaintext.length due to the inclusion of
   TLSInnerPlaintext.type and any padding supplied by the sender.  The
   length of the AEAD output will generally be larger than the
   plaintext, but by an amount that varies with the AEAD algorithm. 
   Since the ciphers might incorporate padding, the amount of overhead
   could vary with different lengths of plaintext.  Symbolically,

      AEADEncrypted =
          AEAD-Encrypt(write_key, nonce, additional_data, plaintext)

   The encrypted_record field of TLSCiphertext is set to AEADEncrypted.

   In order to decrypt and verify, the cipher takes as input the key,
   nonce, additional data, and the AEADEncrypted value.  The output is
   either the plaintext or an error indicating that the decryption
   failed.  There is no separate integrity check.  Symbolically,

      plaintext of encrypted_record =
          AEAD-Decrypt(peer_write_key, nonce,
                       additional_data, AEADEncrypted)

   If the decryption fails, the receiver MUST terminate the connection
   with a "bad_record_mac" alert.

   An AEAD algorithm used in TLS 1.3 MUST NOT produce an expansion
   greater than 255 octets.  An endpoint that receives a record from its
   peer with TLSCiphertext.length larger than 2^14 + 256 octets MUST
   terminate the connection with a "record_overflow" alert.  This limit
   is derived from the maximum TLSInnerPlaintext length of 2^14 octets +
   1 octet for ContentType + the maximum AEAD expansion of 255 octets.

### 5.3. Per-Record Nonce

   A 64-bit sequence number is maintained separately for reading and
   writing records.  The appropriate sequence number is incremented by
   one after reading or writing each record.  Each sequence number is
   set to zero at the beginning of a connection and whenever the key is
   changed; the first record transmitted under a particular traffic key
   MUST use sequence number 0.

   Because the size of sequence numbers is 64-bit, they should not wrap.
   If a TLS implementation would need to wrap a sequence number, it MUST
   either rekey (Section 4.6.3) or terminate the connection. 
   Each AEAD algorithm will specify a range of possible lengths for the
   per-record nonce, from N_MIN bytes to N_MAX bytes of input [RFC5116].
   The length of the TLS per-record nonce (iv_length) is set to the
   larger of 8 bytes and N_MIN for the AEAD algorithm (see [RFC5116],
   Section 4).  An AEAD algorithm where N_MAX is less than 8 bytes
   MUST NOT be used with TLS.  The per-record nonce for the AEAD
   construction is formed as follows:

   1.  The 64-bit record sequence number is encoded in network byte
       order and padded to the left with zeros to iv_length.

   2.  The padded sequence number is XORed with either the static
       client_write_iv or server_write_iv (depending on the role).

   The resulting quantity (of length iv_length) is used as the
   per-record nonce.

   Note: This is a different construction from that in TLS 1.2, which
   specified a partially explicit nonce.

### 5.4. Record Padding

   All encrypted TLS records can be padded to inflate the size of the
   TLSCiphertext.  This allows the sender to hide the size of the
   traffic from an observer.

   When generating a TLSCiphertext record, implementations MAY choose to
   pad.  An unpadded record is just a record with a padding length of
   zero.  Padding is a string of zero-valued bytes appended to the
   ContentType field before encryption.  Implementations MUST set the
   padding octets to all zeros before encrypting.

   Application Data records may contain a zero-length
   TLSInnerPlaintext.content if the sender desires.  This permits
   generation of plausibly sized cover traffic in contexts where the
   presence or absence of activity may be sensitive.  Implementations
   MUST NOT send Handshake and Alert records that have a zero-length
   TLSInnerPlaintext.content; if such a message is received, the
   receiving implementation MUST terminate the connection with an
   "unexpected_message" alert. 
   The padding sent is automatically verified by the record protection
   mechanism; upon successful decryption of a
   TLSCiphertext.encrypted_record, the receiving implementation scans
   the field from the end toward the beginning until it finds a non-zero
   octet.  This non-zero octet is the content type of the message.  This
   padding scheme was selected because it allows padding of any
   encrypted TLS record by an arbitrary size (from zero up to TLS record
   size limits) without introducing new content types.  The design also
   enforces all-zero padding octets, which allows for quick detection of
   padding errors.

   Implementations MUST limit their scanning to the cleartext returned
   from the AEAD decryption.  If a receiving implementation does not
   find a non-zero octet in the cleartext, it MUST terminate the
   connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.

   The presence of padding does not change the overall record size
   limitations: the full encoded TLSInnerPlaintext MUST NOT exceed 2^14
   + 1 octets.  If the maximum fragment length is reduced -- as, for
   example, by the record_size_limit extension from [RFC8449] -- then
   the reduced limit applies to the full plaintext, including the
   content type and padding.

   Selecting a padding policy that suggests when and how much to pad is
   a complex topic and is beyond the scope of this specification.  If
   the application-layer protocol on top of TLS has its own padding, it
   may be preferable to pad Application Data TLS records within the
   application layer.  Padding for encrypted Handshake or Alert records
   must still be handled at the TLS layer, though.  Later documents may
   define padding selection algorithms or define a padding policy
   request mechanism through TLS extensions or some other means.

### 5.5. Limits on Key Usage

   There are cryptographic limits on the amount of plaintext which can
   be safely encrypted under a given set of keys.  [AEAD-LIMITS ]
   provides an analysis of these limits under the assumption that the
   underlying primitive (AES or ChaCha20) has no weaknesses.
   Implementations SHOULD do a key update as described in Section 4.6.3   prior to reaching these limits.

   For AES-GCM, up to 2^24.5 full-size records (about 24 million) may be
   encrypted on a given connection while keeping a safety margin of
   approximately 2^-57 for Authenticated Encryption (AE) security.  For
   ChaCha20/Poly1305, the record sequence number would wrap before the
   safety limit is reached. 





### B.4. Cipher Suites

   A symmetric cipher suite defines the pair of the AEAD algorithm and
   hash algorithm to be used with HKDF.  Cipher suite names follow the
   naming convention:

      CipherSuite TLS_AEAD_HASH = VALUE;

      +-----------+------------------------------------------------+
      | Component | Contents                                       |
      +-----------+------------------------------------------------+
      | TLS       | The string "TLS"                               |
      |           |                                                |
      | AEAD      | The AEAD algorithm used for record protection  |
      |           |                                                |
      | HASH      | The hash algorithm used with HKDF              |
      |           |                                                |
      | VALUE     | The two-byte ID assigned for this cipher suite |
      +-----------+------------------------------------------------+

   This specification defines the following cipher suites for use with
   TLS 1.3.

              +------------------------------+-------------+
              | Description                  | Value       |
              +------------------------------+-------------+
              | TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256       | {0x13,0x01} |
              |                              |             |
              | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384       | {0x13,0x02} |
              |                              |             |
              | TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 | {0x13,0x03} |
              |                              |             |
              | TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256       | {0x13,0x04} |
              |                              |             |
              | TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256     | {0x13,0x05} |
              +------------------------------+-------------+
   The corresponding AEAD algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM, AEAD_AES_256_GCM,
   and AEAD_AES_128_CCM are defined in [RFC5116].
   AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 is defined in [RFC8439].  AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8
   is defined in [RFC6655].  The corresponding hash algorithms are
   defined in [SHS ].

   Although TLS 1.3 uses the same cipher suite space as previous
   versions of TLS, TLS 1.3 cipher suites are defined differently, only
   specifying the symmetric ciphers, and cannot be used for TLS 1.2.
   Similarly, cipher suites for TLS 1.2 and lower cannot be used with
   TLS 1.3.

   New cipher suite values are assigned by IANA as described in Section 11.
