There are no algorithms, state machines, numeric constraints, or detailed cross-RFC mechanics here to analyze; the references to RFC 8907 and RFC 8446 appear correct and consistent with their roles. No plausible inconsistency or underspecification is visible at this level, so deeper expert analysis is better focused on later normative sections."
