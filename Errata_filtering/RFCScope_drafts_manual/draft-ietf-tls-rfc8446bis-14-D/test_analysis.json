The referenced RFC 5246 and RFC 7627 sections match what is described, and the IANA action in §11.1 is consistent with the extension rename. There is an acknowledged and intentional textual mismatch between variable names (“main secret”) and PRF label strings (“master secret”), but this is documented elsewhere in the draft and does not change wire behavior or algorithm semantics. No plausible inconsistency or underspecification that would change protocol behavior or break interoperability is evident."
