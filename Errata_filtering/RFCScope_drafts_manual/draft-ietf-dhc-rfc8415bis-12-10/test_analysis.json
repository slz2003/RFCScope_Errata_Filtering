    "excerpt_summary": "Section 10 instructs that any domain name (or list of domain names) carried in DHCPv6 messages must use the DNS label encoding from RFC 1035 §3.1, and explicitly forbids use of the DNS message compression scheme from RFC 1035 §4.1.4.",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No sequencing, timers, or state transitions are involved; this is a pure encoding rule."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The text doesn’t distinguish behaviors by role (client/server/relay); it defines a common on-the-wire format."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The rule clearly applies to “a domain name or a list of domain names” in DHCPv6 messages; no obvious ambiguity about where it applies."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Using RFC 1035 label encoding without compression is well-defined and widely implemented; nothing here blocks implementability or interoperability."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The only implicit numeric constraint (max 255 octets from RFC 1035 §3.1) is inherited and standard; no apparent inconsistency or range issue."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The single normative statement (“MUST NOT” use compression) is clear and not in tension with other text."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The section delegates the wire format to RFC 1035; no internal ABNF/diagram here to cross-check."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to RFC 1035 §3.1 and §4.1.4 are correct and consistent with long-standing DHCP(DHCPv4/v6) practice of using DNS label encoding without compression."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Terminology (“domain name”, “message compression scheme”) matches DNS/RFC 1035 usage and prior DHCP specs."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Edge cases like maximum name length and label constraints are handled by RFC 1035; nothing new or conflicting is introduced here."
