  "routing_summary": {
    "excerpt_summary": "Section 8 describes the security model for 0‑RTT data in TLS 1.3, the replay threats it poses, and three server-side mitigation strategies (single-use tickets, ClientHello recording with a replay cache, and freshness checks based on ticket age). It also sets client-side requirements about when 0‑RTT may be sent.",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The section talks about windows and ticket lifetimes but does not define a concrete protocol state machine or ordering that appears inconsistent."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Roles (client vs server, “server instance”, zones) are used consistently and align with the rest of the draft."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The text clearly scopes the anti-replay mechanisms as server-side choices and explains that clients cannot assume any particular mechanism; no obvious scope contradiction."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The causal chains (what happens if tickets or ClientHellos are replayed, or if state is or isn’t shared) are coherent and tie into earlier 0‑RTT text without introducing contradictions."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Ticket lifetimes, windows, and sequence-count style limits are described qualitatively; there are no hard numeric constraints here that conflict with other sections."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The mix of MUST/SHOULD about per-instance acceptance, binder validation, and replay mitigation is internally consistent and compatible with related requirements in Sections 4.2.10 and 4.2.11."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "No ABNF/YANG/field layouts are defined here; the prose references earlier-defined structures correctly."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to other sections of this draft (e.g., 2.3, 4.2.10, 4.2.11, 4.6.1, Appendix F.5/F.6) and to prior concepts (tickets, binders, ticket_age_add) appear correct and aligned."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Terms like “0‑RTT data”, “ticket”, “ClientHello”, “PSK binder”, and “server instance” are used consistently with the rest of the document; “instance” is intentionally informal but not contradictory."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Edge cases like freshly started servers, false positives in replay caches, and multi-zone deployments are explicitly discussed and handled at a high level; behavior is intentionally left flexible rather than undefined."
