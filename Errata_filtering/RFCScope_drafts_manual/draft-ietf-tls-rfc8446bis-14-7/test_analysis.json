    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Key schedule is a static derivation graph; no state/event ordering issues appear inconsistent."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Computations are symmetric and per-endpoint; no confusion about which side performs which derivation is evident."

      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The scope of each secret (early, handshake, application, exporter, resumption) is clearly delineated and consistently referenced."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "If implemented literally, the algorithms are executable and match the described security goals; no obvious cause→effect contradictions are visible."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Lengths (Hash.length, key_length, iv_length, zero strings) and bounds (e.g., 2^48-1, 255-byte AEAD expansion) are numerically consistent with the record layer and AEAD model."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Normative requirements around key erasure, limits, and MUST/SHOULD behaviors are internally consistent and do not conflict with each other."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The HkdfLabel struct, key schedule diagram, and formulas for HKDF-Expand-Label, Derive-Secret, traffic key derivation, and exporters align with the prose and with the rest of the document."

      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "References to HKDF (RFC 5869), HMAC (RFC 2104), DTLS 1.3 label prefix behavior (RFC 9147), and X25519/X448 behavior (RFC 7748) are used correctly and without apparent mismatch."

      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The retained use of \"master\" inside HKDF labels (while preferring \"main\" in prose) is explicitly acknowledged and justified for compatibility; naming and usage are consistent."

        "explanation": "Edge cases (missing PSK => zero secret, all-zero X25519/X448 shared secret, AEAD expansion ≤255, sequence number non-wrap) are handled explicitly; no clear gaps in boundary behavior are evident."
