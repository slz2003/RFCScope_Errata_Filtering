You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

USER PROMPT
================================================================================

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 3 states that the former background material on IPv6 relevant to DHCPv6 has been removed from this revision and directs readers to RFC 8415 for that background, keeping the section only for numbering alignment.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - no ordering, timers, or state sequencing are involved.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - no roles, send/receive behavior, or ownership semantics are discussed.
  - Scope: LOW - the text clearly limits itself to non-normative background and simply points to another document.
  - Causal: LOW - referring to RFC 8415 as background does not affect protocol behavior or interoperability.
  - Quantitative: LOW - no numeric ranges, sizes, or counts are present.
  - Deontic: LOW - no normative (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) requirements are in this section.
  - Structural: LOW - no ABNF, diagrams, or formal structures to compare; the content is purely explanatory.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - although it references RFC 8415, doing so as a historical/background reference from a document that obsoletes it is a common and acceptable pattern, not an obvious bug.
  - Terminology: LOW - no definitions or terminology changes appear here.
  - Boundary: LOW - no edge-case or exceptional behavior is described.

Candidate Issues: 1

  Issue 1:
    Type: None
    Label: Use of RFC 8415 solely as historical background reference
