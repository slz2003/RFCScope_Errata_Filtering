The statement that this specification does not define allocation strategies is consistent with earlier text that only constrains address-generation properties (e.g., “SHOULD NOT generate predictable addresses”) without mandating a particular algorithm.

RFC 7824’s Sections 3, 4, and 5 indeed discuss identifiers, existing mechanisms, and attacks affecting DHCPv6 privacy, matching the bullets in Section 24. RFC 7824 Section 4.3 is specifically about allocation strategies and their privacy properties, and RFC 7707 Section 4.1.2 describes how sequential DHCPv6 allocation enables efficient scanning, so pointing to those sections for allocation-strategy considerations is appropriate. RFC 7844 explicitly provides anonymity profiles and mitigation recommendations for DHCP clients, which aligns with the text’s scope (“for the client”), and 7844 itself notes that server-side privacy is a separate topic. The statement that the DHCPv6 specification does not define allocation strategies is also accurate in context: elsewhere it gives only high-level guidance (e.g., “SHOULD NOT generate predictable addresses” and references to privacy RFCs) rather than a specific algorithm, so there is no conflict with those external documents.",
