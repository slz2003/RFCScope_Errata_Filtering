## Report 2: draft-ietf-tls-rfc8446bis-14-1-2

**Label:** Editorial Terminology Change: 'master' to 'main'

**Bug Type:** Editorial

**Explanation:**

The analysis flags an editorial change where 'master' has been renamed to 'main', which could be ambiguous to some readers despite being a stylistic update.

**Justification:**

- The Terminology dimension states that definitions are standard but explicitly notes the 'master'→'main' renaming as an editorial/terminological change. (E2)

**Evidence Snippets:**

- **E2:**

  - Terminology: LOW - Definitions of “client”, “server”, “handshake”, etc. are standard and used consistently; the “master”→“main” renaming is clearly flagged as editorial/terminological.

**Evidence Summary:**

- (E2) The editorial note on the renaming of 'master' to 'main' is mentioned as a low-severity terminology issue.

**Severity:** Low
  *Basis:* Editorial changes generally have low impact on technical correctness, and the analysis rates this under a LOW severity dimension.

**Confidence:** High
