You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Introductory and overview material: defines TLS goals and properties, normative language conventions, relationship to RFC 8446 and older TLS versions, enumerates technical deltas from TLS 1.2, and lists optional updates that affect TLS 1.2.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Mostly static descriptions of properties and high-level changes; no concrete event ordering or state machines here.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Client/server roles are described in broad terms only; nothing that would drive a directional inconsistency on its own.
  - Scope: LOW - Mentions which parts of the document apply to TLS 1.2 vs 1.3, but this is high-level and appears internally consistent.
  - Causal: LOW - Descriptive text about goals and properties, not executable algorithms where cause–effect chains could break.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No field sizes, ranges, counters, or limits in this section that could be internally inconsistent.
  - Deontic: LOW - Uses BCP 14 boilerplate and a few summary bullets of new MUST/SHOULDs, but the actual normative details are elsewhere.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/ASN.1 in this section; only prose and bullets.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Cross-RFC references (5077, 5246, 5705, 6066, 6961, 8996, 9525) match the intended roles and are consistent with how RFC 8446 already treated them.
  - Terminology: LOW - Definitions of “client”, “server”, “handshake”, etc. are standard and used consistently; the “master”→“main” renaming is clearly flagged as editorial/terminological.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behaviors described here; those appear later in protocol details.
