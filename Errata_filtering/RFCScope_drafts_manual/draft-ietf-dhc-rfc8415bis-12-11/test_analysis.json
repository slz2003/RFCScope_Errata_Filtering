Each DHCP client and server has exactly one DUID. See Section 11 for details of the ways in which a DUID may be constructed.”\n      - Section 11: “Each DHCP client and server has a DUID. … The DUID is designed to be unique across all DHCP clients and servers, and stable for any specific client or server. That is, the DUID used by a client or server SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible…” followed immediately by “The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844].”\n      - RFC 7844 (excerpted): anonymity profiles explicitly instruct clients to randomize DUIDs and/or derive them from randomized link-layer addresses, and to *not* use stable identifiers when privacy is desired, e.g., “When using the anonymity profile in conjunction with randomized link-layer addresses, DHCPv6 clients MUST use DUID format number 3 – link-layer address. The value of the link-layer address should be the value currently assigned to the interface.” and “Clients that want to protect their privacy SHOULD generate a new randomized DUID-LLT every time they attach to a new link or detect a possible link change event.”\n    - DetailedReasoning:\n      1. The Terminology section and Section 11 jointly assert two strong, apparently global properties:\n         - Cardinality: each DHCP client and server “has exactly one DUID”.\n         - Stability: for any given client or server, the DUID “SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible.”\n      2. These are written without any scope qualifier (e.g., “at any point in time” or “except when using an anonymity profile”), so a literal reading suggests a device is expected to maintain a single, stable DUID across its entire operational lifetime.\n      3. Immediately after stating the stability goal, Section 11 adds: “The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844].” RFC 7844 in turn requires frequent DUID changes in its anonymity profiles, including generating fresh randomized DUID-LLT or using DUID-LL derived from a changing, randomized MAC address.\n      4. An implementer who reads only this draft could interpret “exactly one DUID” and “SHOULD NOT change over time” as forbidding implementations that routinely regenerate DUIDs, while RFC 7844 explicitly mandates such regeneration when anonymity profiles are in use. Conversely, an implementer may view the single sentence “The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844]” as silently overriding both the cardinality and stability expectations, without any clear statement of how the two are meant to coexist.\n      5. The underlying intent is reasonably clear if you already know RFC 7844: in “normal” operation, a client or server should have a single, stable DUID over time, but a client *may* choose a different behavioural regime (an anonymity profile) in which it intentionally rotates its DUID for privacy. In that regime, “exactly one DUID” is meant “at any given time”, not “over the device’s entire lifetime”.\n      6. However, the current wording does not explicitly scope the “exactly one” and “SHOULD NOT change over time” requirements to non-anonymity operation, nor does it say that they don’t apply when a client intentionally uses an anonymity profile. The only visibility of this exception is the one sentence referencing RFC 7844, which does not state the precedence relationship between the two sets of requirements.\n      7. This ambiguity can cause implementers (particularly of privacy-conscious clients) to wonder whether they are allowed to implement RFC 7844 at all while still claiming conformance to this document, especially given that the DUID-related text here is normative (SHOULD NOT) and not marked as superseded for anonymity scenarios.\n      8. A small clarifying change to the scope of the DUID requirements would resolve this: explicitly state that:\n         - “each client and server has exactly one DUID *at any given time*”;\n         - “for non-anonymity operation, the DUID SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible”;\n         - “when a client follows an anonymity profile as specified in RFC 7844, it MAY change its DUID accordingly, and the stability recommendations in this section do not apply to that mode.”\n      9. Without such scoping language, the reader is left to infer this interaction, which is easy to misinterpret and can lead to either over-constraining privacy implementations (by disallowing DUID changes) or underestimating the stability expectations in non-privacy scenarios.\n\n  - Issue-2:\n    - BugType: Underspecification\n    - ShortLabel: Per‑type DUID generation/storage rules are scoped as unconditional, but there is no explicit exception for anonymity profiles that contradict them\n    - ScopeProblemType: Missing conditionality on DUID-type-specific MUSTs vs. RFC 7844 privacy mode\n    - Evidence:\n      - DUID-LLT (Section 11.2): “Clients and servers using this type of DUID MUST store the DUID-LLT in stable storage and MUST continue to use this DUID-LLT even if the network interface used to generate the DUID-LLT is removed. Clients and servers that do not have any stable storage MUST NOT use this type of DUID.”\n      - DUID-EN (Section 11.3): “each identifier part of each DUID-EN MUST be unique to the device that is using it, and MUST be assigned to the device no later than at the first usage and stored in some form of non-volatile storage. … The generated DUID SHOULD be recorded in non-erasable storage.”\n      - DUID-LL (Section 11.4): “A DUID-LL is recommended for devices that have a permanently connected network interface with a link-layer address and do not have nonvolatile, writable stable storage. A DUID-LL SHOULD NOT be used by DHCP clients or servers that cannot tell whether or not a network interface is permanently attached to the device…”\n      - RFC 7844 (excerpted): requires clients in anonymity profiles to generate new randomized DUID-LLT values per link-change event, and (when using randomized MACs) to use DUID-LL with the *current* (potentially frequently changing) link-layer address as the DUID content.\n    - DetailedReasoning:\n      1. The DUID-type subsections (11.2–11.4) are written as if their requirements applied to *all* uses of that DUID type, with unqualified “MUST” and “MUST NOT” language about storage and persistence.\n      2. For example, any client that ever uses DUID-LLT is told it “MUST store the DUID-LLT in stable storage and MUST continue to use this DUID-LLT even if the network interface … is removed”, and any client without stable storage “MUST NOT use this type of DUID.” Similarly, DUID-EN is required to be provisioned once and stored in non-volatile, ideally non‑erasable storage.\n      3. RFC 7844 anonymity profiles, however, explicitly *repurpose* DUID-LLT and DUID-LL for privacy: they instruct clients to generate new randomized DUID-LLT values when moving to new links, and to tie DUID-LL directly to a randomized MAC that itself changes over time, explicitly *not* storing these DUIDs and *not* using them as stable device identity.\n      4. Section 11 partly acknowledges RFC 7844 with a single sentence (“The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844].”), but the DUID-type subsections do not state that their “MUST store / MUST continue to use” rules are limited to non-anonymity operation or that they are inapplicable when a client is explicitly following a privacy profile.\n      5. This leads to a normative conflict if interpreted literally: a client that both (a) conforms to RFC 7844 and (b) uses DUID-LLT must *not* store DUID-LLT across uses and must regenerate it, but this section says any client “using this type of DUID MUST store [it] in stable storage and MUST continue to use this DUID-LLT.” Both “MUST” requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied.\n      6. In practice, implementers will likely resolve this by treating RFC 7844’s requirements as applying only under specific operating modes, and by *informally* assuming that the DUID-type stability/storage MUSTs here are scoped only to “normal, non‑anonymity” operation. But that scoping is never stated, which makes the standards relationship between the documents unclear.\n      7. Similarly, a pure reading of the DUID-LL text says it is recommended only for devices with “permanently connected” interfaces and no writable NVRAM; yet RFC 7844 specifically wants DUID-LL used with randomized MAC addresses for privacy. That is functionally a different usage pattern than the “permanent hardware anchor” described here, but no note indicates that privacy‑oriented clients are an exception.\n      8. The root problem is that the *domain of applicability* of the DUID-type-specific rules is not stated: they appear to apply to all use of those types, when in fact a well-known and cited profile (RFC 7844) necessarily violates them by design.\n      9. A precise fix would be to add explicit conditionality, for example:\n         - In each DUID-type subsection, qualify the storage/persistence MUSTs as “for non-anonymity operation” or “unless the client is intentionally following an anonymity profile such as that described in RFC 7844”.\n         - Or add a short paragraph near the start of Section 11 stating that when a client operates under an RFC 7844 anonymity profile, the DUID construction and stability rules of that profile take precedence over the type‑specific persistence requirements here.\n      10. Without such explicit scoping, privacy‑oriented implementers are left to reconcile conflicting normative texts on their own, risking either non‑conformant behaviour (by ignoring one side) or over‑conservative designs that avoid implementing anonymity profiles.\n\n- ResidualUncertainties:\n  - The excerpted RFC 7844 text is partial; a full reading might reveal additional nuances (e.g., restrictions on when in the lifecycle DUID changes are permitted) that could influence how strongly the apparent conflicts need to be resolved, but the basic tension in scope (lifetime‑stable vs. privacy-rotating DUIDs) is already evident.\n  - It is not stated whether this draft *formally* updates RFC 7844 or vice versa; an explicit “Updates:” relationship could also help clarify precedence, but that is a document‑level meta‑issue beyond the scope of Section 11 itself.",

The only potentially confusing wording around DUID‑UUID length is resolved unambiguously by the generic DUID definition and the explicit format diagram.\n    - Evidence: Section 11.1 defines a DUID as a 2‑octet type code plus an identifier whose length (excluding the type) is between 1 and 128 octets. Types 1–4 are LLT, EN, LL, and UUID, respectively, with diagrams showing their fields and sizes (hardware type: 16 bits, time: 32 bits, enterprise-number: 32 bits, UUID: 128 bits). The DUID‑UUID section states “This type of DUID consists of 16 octets containing a 128‑bit UUID” and then shows a figure with a 16‑bit DUID‑Type (4) followed by a 128‑bit UUID, matching RFC 6355’s DUID‑UUID format.    \n    - QuantitativeReasoning: \n      - Global DUID constraints: Section 11.1’s constraint that the identifier portion is 1–128 octets implies total DUID size (including the 2‑octet type) is 3–130 octets. All four defined types fit this:\n        - DUID‑LLT: identifier = 2 (hw type) + 4 (time) + L (link‑layer addr) → 6+L bytes. For any realistic L (e.g., 6 bytes for Ethernet per RFC 2464), 6+L is comfortably ≤128.    \n        - DUID‑EN: identifier = 4 (enterprise-number) + N (vendor id), so 4+N ≤128 → N ≤124, which is entirely reasonable for an opaque vendor‑assigned identifier. The example DUID‑EN uses 4 bytes of enterprise number (0x00007ED9 = 32473 per RFC 5612) plus 8 bytes of identifier, for a 12‑byte identifier, i.e., a 14‑octet total DUID, well within limits.    \n        - DUID‑LL: identifier = 2 (hw type) + L (link‑layer addr) → 2+L bytes; again, typical link‑layer addresses are far smaller than 126 bytes.\n        - DUID‑UUID: identifier = 16 bytes, as explicitly stated; total DUID length is 2 (type) + 16 = 18 bytes, which is within 1–128 for the identifier and 3–130 total.    \n      - Client/Server Identifier options: Sections 21.2 and 21.3 specify that option‑len is the “Length of DUID in octets,” which, combined with Section 11.1’s DUID definition (type + identifier), unambiguously means option‑len = 2 + identifier_length. This is consistent across all four DUID types and does not conflict with the 1–128‑octet identifier limit.  \n      - DUID‑UUID wording: The sentence “This type of DUID consists of 16 octets containing a 128‑bit UUID” is potentially ambiguous in isolation, but within this section it clearly refers to the identifier portion:\n        - Section 11.1 already establishes that every DUID has an additional 2‑octet type code before the identifier.    \n        - The DUID‑UUID figure shows a 16‑bit DUID‑Type (4) followed by a 128‑bit UUID field, exactly matching RFC 6355’s definition.      \n      Hence, an implementer following the generic DUID definition and the figure will produce an 18‑octet DUID‑UUID on the wire, which is correct; there is no numeric inconsistency.\n    - Consequences: Because the lengths and field layouts are fully determined by the combination of the generic DUID rules and the explicit per‑type diagrams, independent implementations should encode and parse all four DUID types identically. The minor wording issue around the DUID‑UUID sentence does not produce a plausible alternative on‑the‑wire format (the generic DUID structure plus the diagram rule out “16‑octet total” interpretations), so it is, at worst, editorial and not a source of interoperability bugs.",

Other parts of the draft rely on the DUID as the key for bindings and client/server identification.\n\n- OverallDeonticRisk: None\n\n- Issues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: None\n    - Title: DUID uniqueness/stability vs RFC 7844 anonymity profiles\n    - Description:\n      The text first says that each DHCP participant has a single DUID: “Each DHCP client and server has exactly one DUID” in the terminology section, and “Each DHCP client and server has a DUID” in Section 11. It then states that “the DUID used by a client or server SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible”, reflecting the long-standing design that DUIDs are stable identifiers. Later in the same paragraph, however, it explicitly allows an exception: “The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844].” This is precisely the privacy/anonymity case where RFC 7844 recommends rotating DUIDs together with randomized link-layer addresses and/or link changes  . Under BCP 14, a “SHOULD NOT” admits exceptions when there is a valid reason; the text here names such an exception and points to RFC 7844 as the controlling document. Thus, there is no hard conflict between “SHOULD NOT change” and “may change per RFC7844”: the general rule is stability, with a specific, explicitly documented carve‑out for anonymity profiles.\n      Similarly, “each DHCP client … has exactly one DUID” is naturally read as “one DUID in use by that logical client at any given time”, not “one immutable DUID for the lifetime of the device.” The same section already contemplates DUID changes for operational reasons: e.g., for DUID‑LLT it requires that “a DHCP client that generates a DUID‑LLT … MUST provide an administrative interface that replaces the existing DUID with a newly generated DUID‑LLT”  , which shows that the spec does not treat a DUID as forever fixed. When a client chooses to follow an RFC 7844 anonymity profile, rotating the DUID becomes that “valid reason” to depart from the general stability recommendation. An implementation that keeps a single stable DUID in normal operation but regenerates it as described in RFC 7844 in privacy mode is compliant with both documents: it obeys RFC 7844’s stronger, context‑specific requirements while treating the 8415bis “SHOULD NOT change” as a general rule with a documented exception. This is a reasonable and coherent normative structure rather than an inconsistency.\n    - KeyTextSnippets:\n      - “DUID … A DHCP Unique Identifier for a DHCP participant. Each DHCP client and server has exactly one DUID. See Section 11 for details of the ways in which a DUID may be constructed.”\n      - “The DUID is designed to be unique across all DHCP clients and servers, and stable for any specific client or server. That is, the DUID used by a client or server SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible; … The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844].”\n      - “A DHCP client that generates a DUID‑LLT using this mechanism MUST provide an administrative interface that replaces the existing DUID with a newly generated DUID‑LLT.”\n      - “When using the anonymity profile in conjunction with randomized link-layer addresses, DHCPv6 clients MUST use DUID format number 3 – link-layer address… When using the anonymity profile without the benefit of randomized link-layer addresses, clients … SHOULD generate a new randomized DUID-LLT every time they attach to a new link or detect a possible link change event.”  \n    - Impact:\n      The current text could arguably be made more explicit (for example, by saying “one DUID at any given time” or by explicitly stating that the stability recommendation does not apply when a client intentionally follows an RFC 7844 anonymity profile), but the normative structure is still coherent. An implementer who reads both 8415bis and RFC 7844 can implement stable DUIDs in the normal case and rotating DUIDs for privacy without violating any MUSTs. This is therefore a clarity/editorial improvement opportunity, not a deontic bug.\n\n- IfNoRealIssue:\n  The apparent tension identified by the router arises from reading “exactly one DUID” and “SHOULD NOT change over time” as absolute lifetime guarantees, but Section 11 itself already provides mechanisms for changing DUIDs (e.g., via an administrative interface) and explicitly points to RFC 7844 as a valid reason for a client to change its DUID. Under BCP 14, that combination (general stability as a SHOULD, with an explicit exception) is acceptable and does not create a real normative inconsistency or missing requirement.",

RFC 6355 is referenced for the DUID-UUID format.\n- OverallBugLikelihood: Low\n\nIssues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: Inconsistency\n    - ShortLabel: DUID-UUID prose length vs generic DUID definition\n    - LocationHint: Section 11.1 and Section 11.5 (Figure 8)\n    - Evidence:\n      - Snippet1 (generic DUID definition, Section 11.1):  \n        “A DUID consists of a 2-octet type code represented in network byte order, followed by a variable number of octets that make up the actual identifier. The length of the DUID (not including the type code) is at least 1 octet and at most 128 octets.”\n      - Snippet2 (DUID-UUID prose and figure, Section 11.5):  \n        “This type of DUID consists of 16 octets containing a 128-bit UUID. [RFC6355] details when to use this type and how to pick an appropriate source of the UUID.”  \n        Figure 8 then shows: `| DUID-Type (4) | UUID (128 bits) |` (i.e., 2 octets of type plus 16 octets of UUID).  \n        RFC 6355 likewise defines DUID-UUID as a 16‑octet UUID carried after a 2‑octet DUID-Type field.\n    - TechnicalExplanation: |\n        The generic definition in Section 11.1 states that every DUID is structured as a 2‑octet type code followed by an identifier of 1–128 octets, and all of the concrete DUID diagrams (including Figure 8 for DUID‑UUID) follow this pattern. For DUID‑UUID, the identifier portion is clearly 16 octets (a 128‑bit UUID) following a 2‑octet type field, so the total on‑wire DUID length is 18 octets.\n        \n        However, the prose in Section 11.5 says “This type of DUID consists of 16 octets containing a 128‑bit UUID” without explicitly tying those 16 octets to the identifier portion defined in Section 11.1. Read literally, that sentence contradicts the earlier requirement that all DUIDs have a 2‑octet type plus an identifier: a DUID that “consists of 16 octets” cannot simultaneously include an additional 2‑octet type field. The figure and RFC 6355 both make the intended layout unambiguous (2‑octet type + 16‑octet UUID), so an implementer who follows the diagrams and the external reference will encode DUID‑UUID correctly; nevertheless, the prose in 11.5 is structurally inconsistent with the earlier generic definition and could momentarily mislead a reader skimming only the text.\n    - PatchSuggestion: |\n        Clarify that the 16 octets refer to the identifier portion, not the entire DUID, and align the wording with the generic definition. For example, replace the first sentence of Section 11.5 with something like:\n\n        - Current text:\n          “This type of DUID consists of 16 octets containing a 128-bit UUID.”\n\n        - Suggested replacement:\n          “For this DUID type, the identifier field consists of 16 octets containing a 128-bit UUID; as with all DUIDs, a 2-octet DUID-Type field (value 4) precedes this identifier on the wire.”\n\n        This makes the total DUID structure (2‑octet type + 16‑octet UUID) explicit and removes the textual inconsistency with Section 11.1.",

      "analysis": "CrossRFCReport:\n- ExcerptSummary: Section 11 of rfc8415bis defines the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID), its types and formats (LLT, EN, LL, UUID), and their use in Client/Server Identifier options, with references to external registries (IANA hardware types, IANA Private Enterprise Numbers) and related RFCs (RFC6355 for DUID‑UUID, RFC7844 for anonymity, RFC6939 for link-layer address, RFC2464 for Ethernet addresses).\n- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: Low\n- Issues:\n  - Issue-1:\n    - BugType: Underspecification\n    - ShortLabel: Ambiguous interaction of “one stable DUID” with RFC7844 anonymity profiles\n    - Description: The terminology section defines a DUID as “a DHCP Unique Identifier for a DHCP participant. Each DHCP client and server has exactly one DUID” and Section 11 says the DUID “is designed to be unique … and stable for any specific client or server” and “SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible.” This sets a strong expectation of long-term stability. Later in Section 11, however, the text explicitly allows “The client may change its DUID as specified in [RFC7844],” and RFC7844’s anonymity profile in turn requires DHCPv6 clients with randomized link-layer addresses to use DUID-LL (type 3) derived from the *current* link-layer address and to regenerate DUIDs when changing links or applying anonymity, i.e., DUIDs are intentionally not stable over time  . The combination is logically consistent—at any instant a client still uses exactly one DUID—but the spec never clearly scopes “exactly one” and “SHOULD NOT change over time” as “except when following the anonymity profiles of RFC7844,” leaving a careful implementer to reconcile two competing normative directions. An implementer might incorrectly conclude that using RFC7844-style rotating DUIDs violates the base DHCPv6 requirement for stability, or that servers may safely assume DUIDs are stable identifiers even for privacy-conscious clients, which RFC7844 explicitly contradicts  . A short clarifying statement (e.g., that the stability recommendation does not apply when a client intentionally implements RFC7844 anonymity behavior, and that “exactly one” refers to “at any given time”) would remove this ambiguity and make the cross-RFC relationship explicit.\n    - EntitiesInvolved: [\"draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis-12 Section 4.2 (DUID definition)\", \"draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis-12 Section 11 (DUID stability text)\", \"RFC 7844 Sections 2.2, 4.3, 4.3.1 (DHCPv6 anonymity profile and DUID handling)\"]\n    - CrossRefsUsed: [\"RFC7844 anonymity profile and DUID rules\", \"Base DUID definition and stability requirements in rfc8415bis\"]\n    - Confidence: Medium\n- IfNoIssues:\n  - Comment: Apart from the privacy-related DUID stability ambiguity above, Section 11’s definitions and codepoints appear consistent with the external registries and RFCs referenced. The DUID type codes and formats match the IANA “DUID Types” registry and RFC6355’s DUID-UUID definition (type 4 plus a 16-octet UUID), the use of IANA-HARDWARE-TYPES for hardware type codes in DUID-LLT/LL aligns with both the ARP “Hardware Types” registry and RFC6939’s Client Link-Layer Address option, and the example DUID-EN correctly uses documentation PEN 32473 from RFC5612  . The phrase in Section 11.5 that DUID-UUID “consists of 16 octets containing a 128-bit UUID” is consistent with RFC6355 when read together with Section 11.1’s generic “2-octet type + variable identifier” model, so it does not create an interoperability problem, only a minor editorial ambiguity about total DUID length.",
