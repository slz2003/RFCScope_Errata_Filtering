  "routing_summary": {
    "excerpt_summary": "Appendix B explains the design rationale for using the three ECN-related TCP header flags (AE/NS, CWR, ECE) in AccECN: how they are used during the SYN/SYN-ACK handshake, why four specific codepoints are used on the SYN/ACK to reflect the IP-ECN field, and how remaining codepoints and initial counter values are reserved to allow future protocol evolution.",
    "overall_bug_likelihood": "None",
    "dimensions": {
      "Temporal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Mostly static rationale about bit combinations; no new sequencing or timing logic beyond what is normatively defined elsewhere."
      },
      "ActorDirectionality": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Client/Server roles are referenced only illustratively; no new send/receive rules that could conflict with normative text."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Discussion is clearly scoped to SYN, SYN/ACK, and first ACK uses of the flags; it matches the scoping already defined in Section 3."
      },
      "Causal": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "The text argues design trade-offs but does not introduce new executable algorithms whose literal implementation could break interoperability."
      },
      "Quantitative": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Some counting of possible bit combinations (e.g., “4 out of 8”, “5 codepoints unused”) is present, but it appears consistent with Table 2 and the ACE/option encodings."
      },
      "Deontic": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Almost entirely explanatory; it references normative rules in Section 3 and RFC 3168 but does not itself introduce new MUST/SHOULD-level requirements."
      },
      "Structural": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Refers to header bit layouts and option encodings, but only to justify earlier formal definitions; no new figures or grammars to cross-check."
      },
      "CrossRFC": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Mentions RFC 3168, 3540, 8311, and 9293 in a way that appears consistent with their roles (e.g., NS historic, ECN nonce never using the 1,0,1 combo on SYN/ACK)."
      },
      "Terminology": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Uses labels like “Nonce” and “Broken” for particular handshake patterns exactly as defined earlier in the draft; no apparent naming conflicts."
      },
      "Boundary": {
        "relevance": "LOW",
        "explanation": "Talks about “unused” / “reserved” codepoints and future evolution, but only at a high level and in alignment with the forward-compatibility rules already specified."
