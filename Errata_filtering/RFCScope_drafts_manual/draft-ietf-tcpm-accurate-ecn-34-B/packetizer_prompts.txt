You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Appendix B explains the design rationale for using the three ECN-related TCP header flags (AE/NS, CWR, ECE) in AccECN: how they are used during the SYN/SYN-ACK handshake, why four specific codepoints are used on the SYN/ACK to reflect the IP-ECN field, and how remaining codepoints and initial counter values are reserved to allow future protocol evolution.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Mostly static rationale about bit combinations; no new sequencing or timing logic beyond what is normatively defined elsewhere.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Client/Server roles are referenced only illustratively; no new send/receive rules that could conflict with normative text.
  - Scope: LOW - Discussion is clearly scoped to SYN, SYN/ACK, and first ACK uses of the flags; it matches the scoping already defined in Section 3.
  - Causal: LOW - The text argues design trade-offs but does not introduce new executable algorithms whose literal implementation could break interoperability.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Some counting of possible bit combinations (e.g., “4 out of 8”, “5 codepoints unused”) is present, but it appears consistent with Table 2 and the ACE/option encodings.
  - Deontic: LOW - Almost entirely explanatory; it references normative rules in Section 3 and RFC 3168 but does not itself introduce new MUST/SHOULD-level requirements.
  - Structural: LOW - Refers to header bit layouts and option encodings, but only to justify earlier formal definitions; no new figures or grammars to cross-check.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Mentions RFC 3168, 3540, 8311, and 9293 in a way that appears consistent with their roles (e.g., NS historic, ECN nonce never using the 1,0,1 combo on SYN/ACK).
  - Terminology: LOW - Uses labels like “Nonce” and “Broken” for particular handshake patterns exactly as defined earlier in the draft; no apparent naming conflicts.
  - Boundary: LOW - Talks about “unused” / “reserved” codepoints and future evolution, but only at a high level and in alignment with the forward-compatibility rules already specified.
