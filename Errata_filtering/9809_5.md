## 1) Ambiguous / mis-scoped normative responsibility between CA and “certificate requester” for EKU/KU correctness

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 assigns **BCP 14 MUST** obligations to the “certificate requester” to enforce EKU inclusion and ensure certain KU bits. Section 5 says the CA’s procedures “must ensure” correct EKU/KU values in issued certs, but uses lower-case **must** (non-BCP14 under the document’s own boilerplate). This creates an unclear and asymmetric responsibility split: the actor with real control (CA) is only advised, while the actor that may lack control (requester) has MUST obligations.

**Justification:** underspecification
Experts agree the text can mislead implementers about who is accountable:
- In many PKIs, requesters can only request EKU/KU (CSR/profile); CAs control final contents.
- Lower-case “must” in §5 is non-normative if BCP14 boilerplate is “all-caps only”, so CA obligations appear weaker than requester obligations.
- Without a clear CA-side normative requirement (or a scoped requester duty like “MUST request / MUST reject non-conforming issued certs”), the spec leaves compliance interpretation fuzzy and can cause interoperability failures when relying parties “SHOULD require” EKUs.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality  
- Scope  
- Deontic

**Fix direction:**  
Either:
- make CA obligation explicitly BCP14 (e.g., “CAs **MUST** ensure correct EKU/KU values…”), and/or
- rescope requester obligations to what they can actually do (request/indicate, choose CA/profile, reject non-conforming certs), while keeping CA responsible for what is issued.
