## Issue 1 — Conflicting normative guidance for `KemBMParameter.len`

**Errata title:** Conflicting guidance for `KemBMParameter.len` (prose MUST vs ASN.1 comment SHOULD)

**Concise explanation:**  
The prose definition of `KemBMParameter.len` says `len` **MUST** be “the desired size of the key to be used for MAC-based message protection,” while the ASN.1 module comment says `len` **SHOULD** be “the maximum key length of the MAC function.” These are not equivalent, especially for MACs that accept variable key lengths.

**Justification **  
- The two statements can lead to different interpretations of “correct” `len`:
  - Prose: any policy-chosen key length is allowed, as long as the MAC key actually used is of that length.
  - ASN.1 comment: prefers (and could be read as requiring absent justification) always using the MAC’s maximum key length.
- While this probably won’t break interoperability (both sides still derive the same `ssk` because `len` is explicit), it *can* cause:
  - differing conformance checks (some implementations rejecting non-maximal `len` values), and/or
  - inconsistent security posture across implementations/profiles.

**Minimal fix shape:**  
Make the ASN.1 comment align with the prose, e.g.:
- “`len` MUST equal the MAC key length actually used; in many cases it SHOULD be chosen as the MAC’s maximum supported key length.”
