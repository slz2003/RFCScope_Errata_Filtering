## 1 — Type name inconsistency in prose vs ASN.1

**Errata title:** Prose refers to non-existent `PrivateKeyStatement` instead of `PrivateKeyPossessionStatement`

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 defines the ASN.1 type `PrivateKeyPossessionStatement ::= SEQUENCE { signer IssuerAndSerialNumber, cert Certificate OPTIONAL }`. Immediately after, the prose says: “The components of the **PrivateKeyStatement** SEQUENCE…”. No ASN.1 type named `PrivateKeyStatement` exists anywhere in the document or imports.

**Justification:**  inconsistency 
- All formal ASN.1 (inline and Appendix A) and all other prose consistently use `PrivateKeyPossessionStatement`.  
- The stray name is a clear editorial/terminology error that can confuse implementers mapping prose to ASN.1.

**Minimal patch suggestion:**  
Replace “PrivateKeyStatement” with “PrivateKeyPossessionStatement” in Section 3.

**Experts flagging:** Structural, Terminology

## 2 — Attribute multiplicity not constrained

**Errata title:** Undefined behavior if multiple `privateKeyPossessionStatement` attributes appear

**Concise explanation:**  
PKCS#10/CRMF allow multiple attributes with the same OID, but the text assumes a single possession statement per request and gives no rule if multiple instances are present.

**Justification:**  underspecification  
- Without a rule, CAs may diverge (reject all, accept first, require all to pass).  
- Low practical impact, but worth clarifying.

**Minimal clarification suggestion:**  
Specify that at most one instance is permitted per request, or that all instances must independently pass checks.

**Experts flagging:** Scope
