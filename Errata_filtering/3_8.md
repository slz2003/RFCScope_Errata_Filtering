## 1) `anonymous` (SignatureAlgorithm value 0) marked “N” instead of “D” despite clear discouragement of anonymous authentication elsewhere

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 10 sets:
- `0 | anonymous | Recommended = N`

But in this same draft, anonymous/no-auth mechanisms are explicitly treated as unsafe (e.g., “anon” cipher suites are described as vulnerable to on-path attacks and are marked **D**). Marking `anonymous` as **N** (which §3 defines as “no IETF statement / not evaluated”) is inconsistent with that negative consensus.

**Justification:** ✅ Real semantic inconsistency in guidance (not wire behavior)  
Experts agree this is a “registry guidance” inconsistency:
- §3: **N** implies no IETF suitability statement; **D** is used for discouraged mechanisms that “SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used” depending on context.
- §5: anonymous cipher suites are described as vulnerable and deprecated and are marked **D**.
- §10: the `anonymous` SignatureAlgorithm is left as **N**, which weakens the security signal and can mislead readers that it’s merely “unevaluated” rather than discouraged.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC (medium confidence)  
- Terminology

**Fix direction:**  
Either:
- change `anonymous` from **N → D** and add an explanatory reference/comment, **or**
- keep it N but add explicit text explaining why it is treated differently from anon cipher suites (to remove the current inconsistency).
