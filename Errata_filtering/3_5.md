# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §6 (TLS Supported Groups Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 6 (TLS Supported Groups registry updates)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Ambiguous / non-standard composite registration policy for changing “Recommended” = Y/D

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 6 repeats the global policy sentence (from §3):

> “Setting a value to ‘Y’ or ‘D’ or transitioning the value from ‘Y’ or ‘D’ in the ‘Recommended’ column requires **IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval** [RFC8126].”

This is not a standard RFC 8126 policy name and is grammatically ambiguous.

**Justification:** ✅ Real underspecification (BCP 26 policy ambiguity)  
Experts agree:
- RFC 8126 defines **Standards Action**, **Expert Review**, and **IESG Approval** as separate well-known policies.
- RFC 8126 warns against hybrid phrases (“…only causes confusion”) and requires clear guidance when combining policies.
- The phrase can be read multiple ways (Standards Action + Expert Review vs alternative paths vs IESG-only backstop), so IANA/designated experts cannot apply it mechanically.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Rewrite using canonical RFC 8126 terms with an explicit combination rule (e.g., “either Standards Action or IESG Approval; designated expert review required in all cases”).

## 2) Unclear interaction with RFC 8447’s existing special rule for Supported Groups (Y→N requires IESG Approval)

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 8447 §9 already had a specific rule for this registry:
- setting Recommended=Y requires Standards Action
- **Y→N requires IESG Approval**

Section 6 adds the new generic Y/D policy language but does not clearly say whether it **replaces** or **supplements** the RFC 8447 special-case rule.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Real scope ambiguity (overlapping policies)  
If both are considered “in force,” it is unclear whether Y→N needs:
- only IESG Approval (old rule), or
- “Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval” (new rule), or
- some combination of both.

This ambiguity affects how future Recommended transitions are processed.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope (explicitly flags this interaction)

**Fix direction:**  
Add an explicit statement that the new policy **supersedes** the old special-case text, or clearly specify which rule governs which transitions.

## 3) Comment-column inconsistency: §6 uses a “Comment” column link but §14’s “add Comment column” list omits Supported Groups

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 6 instructs IANA to “add the following link to the **Comment** column” for each discouraged group. But:
- RFC 8447’s description of the TLS Supported Groups registry added a “Recommended” column and registry notes/warnings, **not** a per-entry Comment/Notes column.
- Later, Section 14 of the same draft claims its list covers “all registries that do not already have a Comment/Notes column,” yet **TLS Supported Groups is not listed**.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency + underspecification (registry structure)  
Experts argue this leaves IANA without a clear instruction path:
- Either Supported Groups already has a Comment column (contrary to RFC 8447’s description), or
- it doesn’t, in which case §6 needs to instruct IANA to create it (or §14 must include it).

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (Confidence: Medium–High)

**Fix direction:**  
Either:
- add TLS Supported Groups to §14’s “add Comment column” list, **or**
- explicitly instruct in §6 that IANA must add a Comment/Notes column to the TLS Supported Groups registry before adding per-entry links.

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues for §6 (deduplicated):**
1. **Non-standard, ambiguous registration policy phrase** for Y/D changes (BCP 26 ambiguity).
2. **Policy overlap ambiguity** with RFC 8447’s Y→N special rule for Supported Groups.
3. **Comment-column structural inconsistency** (uses Comment column but document doesn’t clearly ensure it exists).

These are **registry-policy/structure issues**, not wire-protocol issues, but they are strong candidates for pre-publication fixes or errata because they affect IANA’s ability to apply the instructions mechanically.
