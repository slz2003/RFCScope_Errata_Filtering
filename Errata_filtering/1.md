## 1) Ambiguous “corresponding private key” for multi-entry `ECHConfigList`

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 4 requires the publisher to ensure all TargetName IPs point to servers with access to “the corresponding private key” (singular), but the `ech` SvcParam value is an `ECHConfigList` that can contain **multiple** `ECHConfig`s / keys. It is unclear whether each server behind TargetName must support **all** advertised configs or only a subset.

**Justification:** underspecification  
Experts argue clients select **one** `ECHConfig` from the published list independent of which IP they reach. If different IPs behind the same TargetName only possess disjoint subsets of the private keys, some client/IP combinations will fail or trigger ECH rejection/retry behavior, causing intermittent failures and potentially fragmenting anonymity sets. The text does not unambiguously define the required invariant (e.g., “every TargetName IP MUST be able to decrypt any client-selectable ECHConfig in the advertised list (or be authoritative for the public name)”).
