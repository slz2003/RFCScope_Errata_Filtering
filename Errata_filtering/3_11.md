# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §14 (Adding “Comment” Column)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 14 (adds “Comment” columns to listed registries; renames Exporter Labels “Note” to “Comment”)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) TLS Supported Groups uses a “Comment” column that Section 14 never creates

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 6 instructs IANA to “add the following link to the **Comment** column” for TLS Supported Groups entries. But Section 14’s enumerated list of registries to receive a new Comment column does **not** include **TLS Supported Groups**.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency with concrete executability impact  
Experts agree that if IANA follows Section 14 literally, TLS Supported Groups never gets a Comment column, making Section 6’s instruction unimplementable without out-of-band inference.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology

**Fix direction:**  
Add **“TLS Supported Groups”** to Section 14’s list (or otherwise explicitly create/identify the column used by Section 6).

---

## 2) Misstated scope logic in Section 14’s “this list covers all registries …” sentence (“or” vs intended “and”)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 14 claims:
> “This list of registries is all registries that do not already have a ‘Comment’ or ‘Notes’ column **or** that were not orphaned by TLS 1.3.”

Using **or** makes the described set far larger than the enumerated list (almost any non-orphaned registry would qualify, even if it already has Comment/Notes). This prose does not match the actual list and likely misstates the intended condition.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (scope description vs enumeration)  
Experts argue the intended meaning is closer to:
- registries that **lack Comment/Notes** **and** are **not orphaned**, or simply “registries lacking Comment/Notes” (depending on intent).  
As written, the sentence is logically inconsistent with the list and can mislead readers about completeness.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Structural  
- Terminology  
(Causal also notes the wording is “slightly off,” though it emphasizes the enumerated list drives behavior.)

**Fix direction:**  
Rewrite the sentence to match the intended scope (likely replace **or** with **and**, or remove the orphaned clause and describe the list directly).

## 3) Registry-name mismatches in Section 14 list (Hash/Signature and others)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 14 lists registries such as:
- “TLS **Hash Algorithm**”
- “TLS **Signature Algorithm**”

But elsewhere (Sections 9 and 10, and RFC 8447 references) the registries are named:
- “TLS **HashAlgorithm**”
- “TLS **SignatureAlgorithm**”  
(no spaces).

**Justification:** ✅ Real naming inconsistency (IANA instructions should use exact registry names)  
Experts agree this can confuse exact IANA registry targeting and should be normalized.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology

**Fix direction:**  
Change to canonical names used elsewhere in the document (no-space forms).

---

## 4) Potential “Note column” confusion for TLS Exporter Labels (rename “Note” → “Comment”)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 14 (and Section 7) instructs renaming a “Note” column to “Comment” in the TLS Exporter Labels registry. A CrossRFC expert notes RFC 8447’s description may have been “Note:” text blocks rather than an actual table column, so the instruction could be mismatched depending on the registry’s real schema.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Possible inconsistency (depends on actual IANA schema)  
This is not conclusively established from the excerpt alone, but it is flagged as a potential column/schema mismatch.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (confidence: medium, presented as “possible”)

**Fix direction:**  
Confirm whether Exporter Labels has an actual “Note” *column* vs registry-level “Note:” text, and adjust wording accordingly (rename column header vs rename note text).

---

## 5) Other related registry-name mismatches referenced by experts (outside §14 but visible here)

Experts repeatedly point out additional naming errors that interact with IANA clarity:
- Section 5 misnames the target registry (“TLS ExtensionType Values” vs “TLS Cipher Suites”).  
This is not a §14 change itself, but it is part of the same pattern of registry-targeting inconsistencies.

---

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues for §14 (deduplicated):**
1. **TLS Supported Groups Comment column not created** (but required elsewhere) — executability break.
2. **Misstated scope logic (“or” vs intended condition)** — inconsistent description of coverage.
3. **Registry-name spelling drift** (“HashAlgorithm/SignatureAlgorithm” vs spaced variants) — exact-name issue.
4. **Exporter Labels ‘Note’ column rename may be schema-mismatched** (possible; needs confirmation).
