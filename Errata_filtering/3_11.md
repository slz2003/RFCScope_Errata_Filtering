## 1) Misstated scope logic in Section 14’s “this list covers all registries …” sentence (“or” vs intended “and”)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 14 claims:
> “This list of registries is all registries that do not already have a ‘Comment’ or ‘Notes’ column **or** that were not orphaned by TLS 1.3.”

Using **or** makes the described set far larger than the enumerated list (almost any non-orphaned registry would qualify, even if it already has Comment/Notes). This prose does not match the actual list and likely misstates the intended condition.

**Justification:** inconsistency 
Experts argue the intended meaning is closer to:
- registries that **lack Comment/Notes** **and** are **not orphaned**, or simply “registries lacking Comment/Notes” (depending on intent).  
As written, the sentence is logically inconsistent with the list and can mislead readers about completeness.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Structural  
- Terminology  
(Causal also notes the wording is “slightly off,” though it emphasizes the enumerated list drives behavior.)

**Fix direction:**  
Rewrite the sentence to match the intended scope (likely replace **or** with **and**, or remove the orphaned clause and describe the list directly).
