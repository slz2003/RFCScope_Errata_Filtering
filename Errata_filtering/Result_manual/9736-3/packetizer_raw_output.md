## Report 2: 9736-3-2

**Label:** Editorial Typographical Error in Admin Label TLV Description

**Bug Type:** Inconsistency

**Explanation:**

The Admin Label TLV description contains a typographical error with an extraneous 'a' in the phrase regarding string termination.

**Justification:**

- The text incorrectly states 'There is no requirement to terminate the string a with null or any other character' which introduces an unnecessary and confusing article.
- Both Terminology and Structural experts note that this is a minor editorial issue that does not affect the technical encoding.

**Evidence Snippets:**

- **E1:**

  Typo noted by the router in the Admin Label description: “There is no requirement to terminate the string a with null or any other character.”

**Evidence Summary:**

- (E1) Directly indicates the presence of an extraneous 'a' in the text, which serves no technical purpose.

**Fix Direction:**

Remove the extraneous 'a' so that the phrase reads 'There is no requirement to terminate the string with null or any other character.'



**Severity:** Low
  *Basis:* The error is strictly editorial and has no impact on protocol operation or interoperability.

**Confidence:** High
