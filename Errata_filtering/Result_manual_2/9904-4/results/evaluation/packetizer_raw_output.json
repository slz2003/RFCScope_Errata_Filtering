      "explanation": "RFC 9904’s Table 3 assigns digest type 0 ('NULL (CDS only)') a MUST NOT recommendation in all columns, which creates ambiguity by effectively forbidding its use even for the CDS-based DS removal signaling specified in RFC 8078 and described in RFC 8624.",
      "justification": [
        "RFC 9904 Table 3 clearly sets digest type 0 as 'NULL (CDS only)' with MUST NOT for both 'Use' and 'Implement' in all relevant columns, leaving no explicit exception for CDS usage (E1).",
        "In contrast, RFC 8624’s treatment of digest 0 includes an explanatory footnote that permits its special CDS-only use for signaling DS removal per RFC 8078, an important nuance omitted from RFC 9904 (E2)."

          "(E1) RFC 9904 Table 3 shows that digest type 0 is assigned MUST NOT in all delegation and validation aspects.",

This could be done by restoring the explanatory footnote or adding scoped language in Section 4.",
