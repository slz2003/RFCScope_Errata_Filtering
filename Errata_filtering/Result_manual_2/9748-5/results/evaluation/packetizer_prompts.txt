You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 5 of RFC 9748 states that the RFC introduces no new security considerations and that security aspects remain those defined in the underlying documents referenced from the IANA registries (e.g., RFC 7821, 7822, 8915), plus RFC 8126 guidance on registries.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No state machines, sequencing, or timing behaviors are defined in this section.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No client/server or sender/receiver obligations are specified here beyond generic “see other documents”.
  - Scope: LOW - The statement applies globally to “this document”; while broad, it’s consistent with a pure-registry-update RFC and does not create an obvious scoping error.
  - Causal: LOW - The text does not prescribe algorithmic behavior; deferring security to the defining documents does not break any executable procedure.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No sizes, ranges, or numeric limits are discussed in Section 5.
  - Deontic: LOW - The only effective normative content is “adds no new security considerations” and a pointer to other documents; there is no apparent conflict in requirements vs. those referenced RFCs.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/figures in this section; registry tables and structures are elsewhere and unaffected by this brief security paragraph.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Section 5’s cross-reference is generic (“See the References column of the appropriate IANA registry”) and does not contradict the specific security considerations in RFCs 7821, 7822, 8915, or 8126.
  - Terminology: LOW - The use of “extension” is slightly loose (it doesn’t literally apply to all registries, like Reference IDs), but this is wording, not a protocol inconsistency.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behavior or exceptional conditions are described here.
