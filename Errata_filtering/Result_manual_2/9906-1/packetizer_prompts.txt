You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

================================================================================

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 1 of RFC 9906 gives background for deprecating the older GOST R 34.10-2001 / 34.11-94 algorithms in DNSSEC, points to RFC 5933 and RFC 9558 for technical details, and states that the newer 2012 GOST algorithms’ requirement levels are unchanged. Section 1.1 provides standard BCP 14 keyword boilerplate.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timers, or state transitions are described here; it is purely descriptive background.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No client/server or initiator/responder roles are being specified; only general statements about algorithm usage appear.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope (DNSSEC, specific GOST algorithms, and “requirement levels” in general) is clear and high level, without detailed per-context rules.
  - Causal: LOW - There is no algorithmic procedure here; nothing that, if implemented literally, would define behavior beyond “these algorithms are no longer recommended”.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No sizes, ranges, or numeric limits are stated; only algorithm identifiers and years.
  - Deontic: LOW - Section 1 mostly uses informal language (“no longer recommended”) and defers actual normative language to later sections; the BCP 14 boilerplate in 1.1 is standard and correct.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/ASN.1 or detailed field formats in this section; just prose and boilerplate.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 5933, 9364, and 9558 are generally consistent with their roles (5933 and 9558 document use of these algorithms in DNSSEC; 9364 is the DNSSEC BCP); no clear mis-citation is visible from the provided excerpts.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terms like “ECC-GOST” and the algorithm names match their use in RFC 5933 and the IANA registries; the BCP 14 terminology block is the standard RFC 8174 form.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge cases or special conditions are discussed; this is just setting context for the later normative sections.
