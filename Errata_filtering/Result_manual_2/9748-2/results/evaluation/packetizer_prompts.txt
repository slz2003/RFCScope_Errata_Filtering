You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 2 of RFC 9748 provides a brief description of the existing NTP and NTS-related IANA registries (Reference IDs, Kiss‑o'-Death codes, and Extension Field Types), their syntax and registration policies, and notes known issues with the Extension Field Types registry; it also summarizes the NTS registries from RFC 8915 without changing them.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No state machines, ordering constraints, or timing behavior are specified; this is descriptive text about registries.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - The text concerns IANA registries and policies, not protocol roles or message directions.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope of each registry (which protocol, which registry, and which document defines it) is described consistently and at a high level.
  - Causal: LOW - There are no algorithmic instructions here; it’s historical and descriptive, so no direct cause-effect protocol behavior to validate.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Hex values are mentioned illustratively (e.g., 0x0302 vs 0x0203) but there is no internal numeric or size reasoning in this section itself that could be inconsistent.
  - Deontic: LOW - Almost no RFC 2119 language is used in this section; it mostly reports existing policies, not new requirements.
  - Structural: LOW - No formal grammars, tables, or field layouts are defined in Section 2 itself; it only references such structures in other RFCs.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 5905, 5906, 7821, 7822, 8573, and 8915 are consistent with the provided excerpts (e.g., where registries are defined and what they contain).
  - Terminology: LOW - Registry names and terms (e.g., "NTP Reference Identifier Codes", "NTP Kiss‑o'-Death Codes", "NTP Extension Field Types") are used in a way that matches their definitions in the referenced RFCs.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case protocol behavior is being defined here; it only notes that some Extension Field Type values were historically mis-assigned, which is handled later in the document.
