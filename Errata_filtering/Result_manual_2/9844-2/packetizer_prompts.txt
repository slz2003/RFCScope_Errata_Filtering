You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

USER PROMPT
================================================================================

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

================================================================================
ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 2 of RFC 9844 lists informal operational use cases where users need to enter IPv6 link-local addresses with zone identifiers into user interfaces, with examples from debugging tools, router configuration, monitoring tools, Microsoft WSD, and NMEA OneNet. It motivates the later normative requirement that UIs support zone identifiers, and cites hacks and related technologies.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timers, or state ordering are defined; the text is purely descriptive of scenarios.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Roles like “user”, “tool”, or “router” are mentioned only informally; no protocol obligations or message directions are specified.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope is clearly “example use cases” and not normative rules; nothing hinges on per-object vs global scoping.
  - Causal: LOW - The causal relationships (e.g., “if the tool does not support zone identifiers, you can’t use fe80::1%eth0”) are explanatory and not part of an algorithm whose correctness needs checking.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Only illustrative addresses (e.g., 192.168.178.1) are given; no ranges, limits, or size calculations that could conflict elsewhere.
  - Deontic: LOW - No RFC 2119 language appears in Section 2; it is non-normative narrative.
  - Structural: LOW - There is no ABNF, YANG, field table, or formal syntax in this section; just prose and example literals.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 1918, RFC 6991, and external documents are used illustratively; nothing obviously contradicts the cited material in a way that would affect implementers.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terms like “link-local address”, “zone identifier”, and “private address” are used in the usual sense; no apparent naming or concept mix-ups are visible in this section.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behavior or boundary conditions are specified here; it is all high-level usage description.
