      "bug_type": "Underspecification",
      "explanation": "RFC 9829 Section 5 overstates the security offered by the manifest hash by claiming it guarantees that the CRL is the most recent and eliminates replay vectors, whereas in reality it only binds the CRL to a given manifest without preventing replay of older, self‐consistent manifest+CRL sets.",
      "justification": [
        "The text states that the manifest hash 'provides a cryptographic guarantee on the Certification Authority's intent that this is the most recent CRL and removes possible replay vectors,' which merges the binding property with a broader replay protection claim (Temporal Expert T1, Scope Expert Issue-1).",
        "Additional analysis shows the hash only prevents substitution of a different CRL within a fixed manifest, leaving replay or rollback of an older valid manifest+CRL pair unaddressed (Causal Expert, CrossRFC Expert Issue-1, Boundary Expert Finding-1)."
