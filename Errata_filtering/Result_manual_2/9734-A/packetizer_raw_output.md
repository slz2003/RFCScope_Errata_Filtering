## Report 1: 9734-A-1

**Label:** Underspecified Candidate Issue in Appendix A Candidate Issues Section

**Bug Type:** Candidate Issue – Underspecified Details

**Explanation:**

The analysis reports one candidate issue with no further details provided, leaving the nature of the potential erratum ambiguous.

**Justification:**

- The Candidate Issues section lists 'Issue 1' with Type: None, an empty Label, and no additional explanation (E1).
- This lack of detail (the Sketch is merely '...') makes it unclear if any real error exists or if it is an oversight in reporting (E1).

**Evidence Snippets:**

- **E1:**

  Candidate Issues: 1

  Issue 1:
    Type: None
    Label:

**Evidence Summary:**

**Severity:** Low
