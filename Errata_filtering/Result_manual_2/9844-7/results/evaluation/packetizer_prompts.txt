You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 7 simply states that RFC 9844 has no IANA actions, i.e., it does not define or modify any IANA-managed registries. The rest of the document defines UI behavior for IPv6 zone identifiers and updates/obsoletes other RFCs purely at the specification-text level.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timers, or state ordering are involved in an IANA-Considerations statement.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No protocol roles or message directions are described here.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope (“no IANA actions”) is clear and limited to IANA; nothing suggests a scoping mistake.
  - Causal: LOW - Declaring no IANA actions does not itself create problematic behavior in implementations.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No numeric fields, sizes, or ranges are involved.
  - Deontic: LOW - No RFC 2119 normative requirements appear in Section 7.
  - Structural: LOW - There are no formal structures (ABNF, YANG, tables) in this section to compare against.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - Although the RFC updates/obsoletes other RFCs (4007, 6874, 7622, 8089), that is handled in earlier sections and does not appear to require registry changes; still, an expert might very lightly confirm that none of those updates touch IANA registries.
  - Terminology: LOW - The terminology (“IANA actions”) is standard and unambiguous here.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behavior or special conditions arise from “no IANA actions”.
