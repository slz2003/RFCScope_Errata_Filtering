You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 2 of RFC 9906 normatively deprecates the use of GOST R 34.11-94 in DS records and GOST R 34.10-2001 (ECC-GOST) in DNSKEY/RRSIG records for DNSSEC, and specifies how validating resolvers must treat such records (as insecure/unsupported).
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timing, or state-machine ordering is involved; rules are static “MUST/MUST NOT” behaviors.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Roles (signers/zone operators vs validating resolvers) are clear and correctly assigned; no sender/receiver confusion is evident.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope (DS vs DNSKEY/RRSIG, creation vs validation behavior) is explicitly stated and matches DNSSEC concepts; no scope bleed is apparent.
  - Causal: LOW - If implemented literally, behavior is clear and coherent: deprecated algorithms are no longer used for signing and are treated as insecure/unsupported by validators; no obvious breakage or contradictions arise.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No numeric ranges, lengths, or counts are specified in this section.
  - Deontic: LOW - The MUST / MUST NOT requirements are internally consistent and align with deprecation intent; they override the earlier “MAY support” language in RFC 5933 in a straightforward way.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF, YANG, or field layouts are present in this section.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 5933 for GOST R 34.10-2001 (algorithm 12) and GOST R 34.11-94 (digest type 3) are appropriate and consistent with how those algorithms are used in DNSSEC.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terms like DS, DNSKEY, RRSIG, “ECC-GOST”, and “insecure” are used consistently with DNSSEC terminology; no apparent naming conflicts.
  - Boundary: LOW - Edge cases (e.g., presence or absence of other “accepted” algorithms) are handled in the usual DNSSEC way (treat as insecure when only deprecated/unsupported algorithms are present); no obvious missing corner-case behavior.
