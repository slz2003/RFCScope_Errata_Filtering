You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 1 introduces the problem that existing 8-bit OSPF prefix flag fields (OSPFv3 PrefixOptions and OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV Flags) are almost exhausted and states that this document addresses that by defining a new variable-length Prefix Extended Flags sub-TLV for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. Section 1.1 provides the standard BCP 14 requirements-language boilerplate.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timers, or state transitions are described in this introductory text.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No sender/receiver role logic or directionality rules are specified here.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope (OSPFv2 vs OSPFv3, existing fixed-size fields vs new sub-TLV) is clearly distinguished and not internally contradictory in this section.
  - Causal: LOW - The text is descriptive (motivation and overview) and does not specify executable algorithms whose behavior might be broken.
  - Quantitative: LOW - The only quantitative statements (8-bit fields, “only 5 bits remain”, all OSPFv3 bits assigned) are consistent with the referenced registries as summarized.
  - Deontic: LOW - The only normative language in this section is the standard BCP 14 boilerplate, which is conventional and self-consistent.
  - Structural: LOW - No formal structures (ABNF/YANG/bit layouts) are defined in Section 1; the figure and detailed sub-TLV format appear later.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - References to RFC 5340 Appendix A.4.1.1, RFC 7684 Section 2.1, and the IANA registries are used in a straightforward way and match the summarized content (all OSPFv3 prefix option bits assigned; 3 of 8 OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV flags assigned).
  - Terminology: LOW - The terminology (e.g., “OSPFv3 Prefix Options”, “OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV”, “existing fixed-size prefix flags”) is used consistently and aligned with referenced documents.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge cases or boundary conditions are discussed in this introductory section.
