You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTER ANALYSIS

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 5 of RFC 9792 claims that the new Prefix Extended Flags sub-TLVs do not change the existing OSPFv2/OSPFv3 security models and points readers to the Security Considerations sections of RFC 7684 and RFC 8362 for further discussion.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timing, or state-machine behavior is discussed in this security boilerplate.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No sender/receiver role nuances are introduced here; it only references existing security models.
  - Scope: LOW - The text broadly states that “procedures and protocol extensions” do not affect security models; this is high-level but not internally inconsistent or clearly mis-scoped.
  - Causal: LOW - There is no detailed causal description of attacks or mitigations; it only asserts that security properties are unchanged.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No sizes, limits, or numeric ranges appear in this section.
  - Deontic: LOW - The section uses no new RFC 2119 language beyond what is in the referenced RFCs; it doesn’t introduce conflicting requirements.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/diagrams or other formal structures appear here.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - The references to “Section 5 of RFC 7684” and “Section 7 of RFC 8362” correctly point to those RFCs’ Security Considerations sections; section numbers and intent align.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terminology is generic (“security models”) and references existing OSPFv2/OSPFv3 security discussions without introducing new or conflicting terms.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case behaviors are specified here; malformed TLV handling and related robustness considerations are delegated to the referenced documents.
