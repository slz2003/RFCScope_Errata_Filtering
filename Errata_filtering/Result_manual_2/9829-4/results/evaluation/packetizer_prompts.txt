You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 4 of RFC 9829 states that this document introduces no additional operational considerations beyond those already described in Section 9 of RFC 6487, and the referenced Section 9 describes a general procedure for handling future profile changes and profile agility in the RPKI.
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No ordering, timing, or state-machine behavior is described in the excerpt itself.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - The excerpt does not assign new behaviors or responsibilities to specific roles; it only references existing operational guidance.
  - Scope: LOW - The scope statement (“no additional operational considerations beyond…6487 §9”) is broad but not internally contradictory; it simply asserts that existing operational guidance suffices.
  - Causal: LOW - There is no concrete algorithm or process here whose step-by-step behavior might break; it’s a meta-statement about the absence of extra considerations.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No numeric limits, ranges, or size-related constraints appear in this section.
  - Deontic: LOW - Section 4 itself introduces no new MUST/SHOULD-level requirements; the referenced Section 9 does, but that is not modified here.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF, YANG, tables, or formal structures are involved in this excerpt.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - There is a simple, correct-looking reference to RFC 6487 §9; nothing suggests a wrong section or registry reference.
  - Terminology: LOW - Terminology is minimal and consistent; it reuses “operational considerations” and the RPKI context from RFC 6487.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case operational behaviors are singled out; the text is purely a high-level statement.

Candidate Issues: 1

  Issue 1:
    Type: None
    Label: No plausible specification error in the “no additional operational considerations” statement
    Relevant Dimensions: 
    Sketch: The section merely asserts that RFC 9829 does not add to the operational considerations already laid...
