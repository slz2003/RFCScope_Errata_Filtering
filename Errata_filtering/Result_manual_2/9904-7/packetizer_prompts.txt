You are ErrataPacketizer.
Input: an analyzer output containing router analysis and multiple expert analyses.
Task: produce deduplicated errata reports as structured JSON.

Constraints:
- Read the ENTIRE analysis carefully from start to finish. Do not skip any sections.
- Extract ALL issues mentioned anywhere in the analysis, including:
  * candidate issues (even if marked as "candidate" or "potential")
  * Expert-identified issues (even if experts conclude "no issue" or "editorial only")
  * Issues discussed in expert reasoning sections, even if not in formal issue lists
  * Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, or problems mentioned in any part of the text
  * Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "underspecification", or similar
- Only use information present in the input text.
- Labels must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (include specific terms, values, or section references when relevant).
- Evidence snippets (5a) must be copied verbatim from the input text (without quotes). Snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand and verify the issue. Do not use partial snippets.
- Evidence summary (5b) must be derived ONLY from the evidence snippets E1..En and must cite (E#) per bullet.
- Deduplicate: merge issues that refer to the same underlying erratum and list all experts.
- Severity/Confidence: prefer explicit expert values; otherwise infer conservatively and state "inferred".

Read the ENTIRE analyzer output below carefully from start to finish. Extract ALL issues, problems, inconsistencies, or ambiguities mentioned anywhere in the text.

Include ALL issues mentioned in the analysis:
- Router candidate issues (even if marked "candidate" or "potential")
- Expert-identified issues (check all expert sections: Scope, Causal, Quantitative, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology, etc.)
- Issues discussed in expert reasoning/analysis sections, even if not in formal issue lists
- Any inconsistencies, ambiguities, underspecifications, or problems mentioned anywhere
- Issues labeled as "potential", "candidate", "may cause", "editorial", "underspecification", or similar
- Do NOT skip issues just because an expert concludes "no issue" or "editorial only" - if it's discussed, include it

Produce deduplicated errata reports as JSON.

Each errata report MUST contain exactly these fields:
1) label: Errata short Label (must be explicit and descriptive - readers should understand the problem at a glance, e.g., "Misnamed LDAP/X.509 CA certificate attribute ("caCertificate" vs "cACertificate")")
2) bug_type: Bug Type
3) explanation: Concise Explanation (1-2 sentences, neutral)
4) justification: Justification (array of bullets, must be supported by Evidence snippets)
5) evidence: Object with:
   - snippets: Array of {id: "E1", text: "..."} (verbatim, complete and sufficient excerpts, no quotes around text)
   - summary: Array of strings, each citing (E1), (E2), etc.
6) fix_direction: Fix Direction if exists, else null
7) severity: Low | Medium | High | Unspecified
8) severity_basis: Basis for severity
9) confidence: High | Medium | Low | Unspecified
10) experts: Array of "ExpertName: issue_id" strings

Constraints:
- Label must be explicit and descriptive - clearly state what the problem is so readers understand it at a glance (e.g., include specific terms, section references, or conflicting values when relevant).
- Evidence snippets must be verbatim from input (format: text directly, no quotes).
- Evidence snippets must be complete and sufficient - include all relevant context needed to understand the issue.
- Evidence summary must cite (E1), (E2), ... and contain no new facts beyond snippets.
- Keep each errata report concise.

ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 7 of RFC 9904 gives IANA-specific instructions to update the “DNS Security Algorithm Numbers” and “Digest Algorithms” registries: add four recommendation columns, populate them from Tables 2 and 3, change registration procedures, add explanatory notes, and make some structural changes (e.g., reserve ranges, remove legacy “Status” column).
Overall Bug Likelihood: None

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - The text is declarative (“IANA has updated…”) with no sequencing or state-machine logic that could conflict.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Only IANA is the actor, and responsibilities are straightforward registry edits; no request/response or role confusion.
  - Scope: LOW - The instructions are clearly scoped to the two named registries and to specific columns and value ranges; no obvious scope leakage or mismatch.
  - Causal: LOW - No protocol behavior or algorithm is defined here; it only describes registry structure and policy, so no causal chains that would break implementations.
  - Quantitative: LOW - The only numeric aspects (algorithm numbers and digest value ranges like 128–252, 253–254) are consistent with typical registry practice and clearly framed as assignments, not constraints on packet formats.
  - Deontic: LOW - Normative language about registration policy (Standards Action vs Specification Required) is consistent with the detailed rules already spelled out in Section 2.2; section 7 simply restates outcomes for IANA.
  - Structural: LOW - No ABNF/YANG/ASN.1; registry structure changes (adding/removing columns, adding notes) align with the earlier descriptive text in Sections 2–4 and do not contradict it.
  - CrossRFC: LOW - The changes consciously update the registries that originated with RFC 4034/4035/etc.; later RFC 9904 is allowed to refine those, and no incorrect cross-reference or registry name/ID appears.
  - Terminology: LOW - Registry names, column names (“Use for DNSSEC Signing”, “Implement for DNSSEC Validation”, etc.), and the “Reserved / Reserved for Private Use” terminology match standard IANA usage and are consistent with earlier sections.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge-case protocol behavior is specified; only registry metadata is changed, and the assignments (e.g., reserving 128–252, private-use 253–254) are explicit and self-contained.
