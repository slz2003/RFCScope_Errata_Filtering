## Issue — Alice/Bob Role Description Is Inconsistent with Later Appendix E Flows

**Type:** Inconsistency 

**Where:** Appendix E (KEM-based MAC protection message flows), in relation to Section 5.1.3.4

### Concise Description
Appendix E’s introductory text states that **“Alice indicates the PKI entity”** (i.e., the CMP client) that uses a KEM key pair, while **Bob** provides the KEM ciphertext. This description is **only true for the first flow**. In later flows (Figures 4 and 5), **Alice is actually the PKI management entity** (CA/RA) that owns the KEM key pair, and **Bob is the PKI entity** (client) that provides the ciphertext. Thus, the Alice/Bob description is inconsistent with the subsequent flows.

### Evidence
- **Generic definition (Section 5.1.3.4):**  
  *Alice* = the party that **owns the KEM private key** and produces MACs.  
  *Bob* = the party that **has Alice’s public KEM key** and sends the KEM ciphertext.  
  (This definition is role-agnostic: Alice/Bob are abstract protocol roles, not client/server.)

- **Appendix E introductory sentence:**  
  > “Alice indicates the PKI entity that uses a KEM key pair …”

- **Figure 3:**  
  - *Alice* = PKI entity (client) ✔️  
  - *Bob* = PKI management entity (server)

- **Figure 4 (and Figure 5):**  
  - *Alice* = PKI management entity (server) ❌ relative to the intro sentence  
  - *Bob* = PKI entity (client)

### Why This Is a Real Issue
The **flows themselves are correct**, but the **introductory prose misbinds Alice/Bob to organizational roles (PKI entity vs. PKI management entity)** instead of keeping them as abstract cryptographic roles. This can mislead implementers into assuming that the **client always owns the KEM key pair**, which is false in Figures 4 and 5.


### Minimal Fix Suggestion
Change the Appendix E introduction to decouple Alice/Bob from client/server roles. For example:

> “In the following message flows, *Alice* denotes the party that owns the KEM key pair, and *Bob* denotes the peer that uses Alice’s public KEM key to generate a ciphertext, as described in Section 5.1.3.4. Depending on the scenario, Alice may be either the PKI entity or the PKI management entity.”

This aligns Appendix E with the abstract role definition already used in Section 5.1.3.4.
